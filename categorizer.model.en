History Like many other cities of Continental Europe, Vienna originated in ancient Roman times. In the first century AD, the Romans set up a military camp, called Vindobona, which formed part of the large number of similar facilities along the Limes frontier. The camp was situated in what is today the core of the city. The course of the wall is reflected, to this day, in a series of very striking streets in the inner city. From the third century, there is evidence for a civilian settlement in the southeast, a little outside the camp. Much less is known about its layout and buildings, however, than about the camp. Neither of these facilities on the site of the present city had any significance within the ancient cityscape of Austria. The late 4th and 5th centuries began to see the dramatic decline not only of the Roman Empire in general but also of Vindobona in particular. Archaeological evidence provides information of a devastating fire in the storage area at the beginning of the 5th century. No written records have survived from the period between the 5th to 6th centuries and the 9th century to tell about the fate of this small settlement on the Danube. But research on the basis of archaeological and onomastic evidence suggests that we must assume that at least some remainder settlement continued to exist. The protection provided by the remnants of the ancient camp fortifications, which continued well into the 13th century, was made further use of. It may have been as early as the Carolingian period that the first churches were established in the area. Of course, it would be impossible to speak of a city or even urban structures, particularly in the light of the fact that the settlement, whose present name was first mentioned in 881, was to see turbulent times in the wake of the Magyar expansion, in the 9th and 10th centuries. It was only after the Magyar threat had been contained, following the Battle of the Lechfeld in 955, and the establishment of the margravate of Austria under the Babenbergs (976) had brought forth a quasi-state that the basis for a general increase in settlement in the fledgling country was laid. The effects did not become fully palpable for Vienna. The city continued to sit virtually on the Magyar frontier well into the 12th century, until the Austrian sovereigns from the Babenberg dynasty had finally consolidated their position. Until the first half of the 12th century, the center of Babenberg power lay west of Vienna. Around 1150 the Austrian margraves, who were also dukes of Bavaria at the time, transferred their residence to Vienna. They founded Vienna's oldest monastery, Sankt Maria zu den Schotten (St. Mary of the Scots). This (now) direct contact with the sovereigns contributed strongly to Vienna's unfolding into a veritable town. It is interesting to underline that Vienna was not founded by a lord, but that, on the other hand, the role of the sovereign was a significant one. The shining light emulated was most of all the old Bavarian capital of Ratisbon, which Vienna outdid, however, within a few decades. The outward sign of any medieval city was its surrounding wall. Vienna's city wall was built around 1200. The community was granted its first privilege in 1221. Vienna was termed one of the principal cities of the empire after Cologne. At that time, in the early 13th century, Vienna was already part and parcel of an extensive network of trade relations. This network made use of the Danube route and benefited from intensive contacts with Venice. A major upgrading came with the granting of the so-called Stapelrecht. Under this privilege non-resident tradesmen had to display their goods for sale in the city. This afforded the Viennese the very profitable opportunity to act as middlemen. The city's expansion and development is particularly reflected in the increasing splendor and number of churches, although the foundations thereto had been laid by the Babenbergs still. There was growing construction at the time even in the suburban area, outside the walls, and development crystallized along the main arteries leading into and out of the city. The late Middle Ages deserve to be called a heyday of burgher autonomy although conflicts with the sovereigns - to wit the Habsburgs from 1276/83 - recurred again and again. It is interesting to note in this context that the Habsburgs lost the imperial crown upon the death of Frederick the Fair (1330) for more than a century. They did not regain it until 1438, when Albert II came to power. In the 14th century, the cityscape was refashioned in Gothic style. This appearance was to prevail until the early 17th century. The most obvious example is doubtless the redesign of the parish church of St. Stephen's, which did not become a bishopric until 1469. The intellectual appeal of the city, which was largely dominated by the Habsburg court, was dramatically enriched with the establishment of the University of Vienna in the 14th century still. In the late Middle Ages political and social tensions among the burghers of Vienna often mirrored dynastic quarreling within the House of Habsburg. Nevertheless the city was spared the kinds of constitutional conflicts known from many other European cities. On the contrary, 1396 saw the number represented within the city government of various groups of burghers, especially the so-called Erbbürger, or patricians, as well as tradesmen and craftsmen set down in a well-regulated way. The economic mainstay of the city was, on the one hand, trade, and, on the other hand, wine-growing. Wine was the principal export, and this considerable wine production was protected by import bans on foreign, particularly Hungarian, wines. With this in mind, it is hardly surprising that the political unrest of the 15th century, beginning with the Hussite Wars and including the strife between Emperor Frederick III and his brother, Archduke Albert VI, and the Hungarian occupation of Vienna under King Matthias I Corvinus (1485 to 1490), affected these very pillars of Vienna's economy drastically. Especially the Stapelrecht was becoming more and more ineffective. The pressure exerted by foreign tradesmen who had been doing business in the city for a long time as well as the growing dependence of the Habsburgs on the financial prowess of powerful trade dynasties such as the Fuggers eventually prompted Emperor Maximilian to repeal the privilege in the early 16th century. In 1529 the city was besieged by the Turks. Although Vienna was not conquered, the siege was to have a dramatic impact on its physical structure. As early as 1530 work was undertaken to replace the now inefficient medieval city walls by modern fortifications and bastions, built on the Italian model. The suburbs had suffered the worst damage in 1529. Much of the building activity in the city until the mid-17th century concentrated on the fortifications. This also included the provision of a wide strip of land around the city, the so-called glacis, which was to be kept clear of construction. But the contemporary topography was also, to a large extent, shaped by the building of monasteries, which had meanwhile begun to mirror the architectural upswing of the suburbs. At the same time, a growing Baroque element became noticeable in the cityscape of the early 17th century. The successful repulsion of the Turkish besiegers in 1529 had earned the city great international prestige. Travelogues and descriptions from the 16th century already testify to the metropolitan character of Vienna with strikingly tall buildings, but also narrow lanes, and altogether vibrant urban life. However, this also marked the beginning of the end of late medieval burgher autonomy. The renewed rise to glory of the Habsburgs, who returned to being Holy Roman Emperors in 1438, left little space for that. Even the beginnings of Vienna, under the Babenbergs, had been marked by the city's role as a residence, and this tendency became more strongly apparent still with the dawn of the early modern age. At the time, Vienna became the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and the residence of the Emperor. This is reflected not least in the fact that all building activity was dominated by the court, the aristocracy and the church. The court resided at Hofburg Palace, to which were added, from the 17th and 18th centuries, summer residences in the suburbs (Schönbrunn Palace). The aristocratic families built their palaces in the city and the suburbs, emulating court styles. The church was closely linked with the sovereign in responding to the religious reform ideas emerging and spreading in the 16th century, and commissioned a veritable spate of monasteries. Such building activities reflected the ownership situation in the city, the urban area being held by numerous landlords and the city administration being only one of them. The second Turkish siege, in 1683, again affected the physical and building structure of the city drastically. Although the combination of modern fortifications and valor on the part of the city's defenders had allowed the city to withstand the onslaught. The city walls as well as individual buildings in the inner city suffered severe damage. He also dissolved a number of monasteries and reformed parish church services. His endeavors were mostly directed against monastic communities chiefly devoted to a life of contemplation. He sought to encourage the establishment of a dense network of new parishes to improve religious services for the population. Particularly the dissolution of monasteries in the inner city made available both buildings and sites, which were put to new uses. The measures taken by Joseph II also included an order to relocate existing cemeteries from densely built-up areas, although this tendency had become apparent in the inner city as early as the first half of the 18th century. The city continued to maintain its defense walls, even at a time when other cities in Europe were beginning to defortify on a massive scale. What little protection they could actually provide was shown in the early 19th century when Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte occupied Vienna in 1805 and 1809. Upon his departure in autumn 1809 large parts of the fortifications were blasted away to demonstrate his military prowess. Vienna failed to turn this into an opportunity for modernisation. On the contrary, one of the hallmarks of the restoration period in Austrian politics during the era of Chancellor Metternich (until 1848) was the complete absence of any thought of razing the defenses In fact, the destruction of the Napoleonic wars was not sufficiently made use of to launch an urban expansion drive, except, to some extent, in Hofburg Palace, although even there a new city gate, the Äußeres Burgtor, was built. Incidentally, it is the last surviving monument of the old times. Particularly during the decades of the so-called Pre-March Period, that is from the Congress of Vienna (1814 to 1815) to the revolution in March 1848, modernization of the building stock and infrastructure began to be more and more urgent. Extraordinarily disparate developments and tendencies characterized this pre-revolutionary period. On the one hand, Vienna experienced an age of cultural excellence, and mention must be made in this context of such composers as Beethoven, Schubert or Johann Strauss the Elder, such literary achievements as those of Franz Grillparzer or Ferdinand Raimund, the classic and the popular playwright respectively, and Biedermeier art, be it painting or furniture making. On the other hand, the period was marked by the onset of rapid industrialization combined with grave social problems (for example child labor) and the gradual realization that the infrastructure was in a deplorable condition (water pipes and sewers, for instance). Vienna had been devastated repeatedly by severe plague epidemics between the 14th and early 18th centuries, and the massive outbreak of cholera in 1831-32 was an eloquent indication of the highly inadequate drinking water supply of a steadily growing city. The dawn of the industrial revolution ushered in a new era in Vienna. While the beginnings of steamship navigation on the Danube and of railway lines go back to the Pre-March Period, comprehensive programs to improve the urban infrastructure were slow to materialize. The city fathers at the time were above all trying to buy properties to minimize the negative effects of the fragmentation of the urban area and administration into many different land ownerships. Obviously, they confronted not only financial limitations. Attempts at modernization on a Western European scale, such as the construction of meat markets to improve food supplies for the city, met similar difficulties. It was only the revolutionary year of 1848, with its, admittedly, temporary success in striving for a constitution, that opened up a new era, at least as far as the abolition of the existing landownership pattern at the time is concerned. The landlords' administrative and judicial rights were now transferred to government institutions. For Vienna itself, all obstacles thrown in the way by the conflicts arising between the landowners were eliminated once and for all. In 1850 the city launched its first expansion drive by incorporating the suburban zone within the Linienwall and organizing it into city districts. With an entirely new territorial context, the question of the continued existence of the fortification walls at long last gained more topical interest. For some years, the military circles were able to hold their own in maintaining their demand for these massive demarcations, making a case for the defenses, most of all, in the light of the revolutionary developments of those years. It was not until 1857 that Emperor Francis Joseph decided to have the defenses razed. The now available building land - and prime building land it was too - was immediately incorporated into all planning programs The land included not only the walls themselves but the entire belt of old military fortifications, hence a wide ring around the inner city. To this day, the name of Vienna is associated on the international level with the term Ringstrasse, the splendid boulevard with its many stately public buildings, which was built in lieu of the fortifications at the time. Designed in the new style of the day, historicism, new government departments, museums, the court (now state) opera and the parliament building (which is still in use today), the new university and many other structures went up. Well into the 1870s a fairly large area along Ringstrasse continued to be used for military purposes, as a parade and exercising ground. It was only at a relatively late point in time that the new City Hall was built in this location in neo-Gothic style. The City Hall has continued to be the seat of the city government to this day. The City Council, the city's legislature, was elected following the constitutional amendments of 1848. But it was not until 1907 for men and 1919 for women that the considerably restricted right to vote was expanded to the meanwhile accustomed scope and consolidation. With the new territorial context laid down in 1850, the city government, which had also been given a new constitution, was able, over the next decades, to embark upon a series of infrastructural programs which were long overdue. At first, the city used the services of private enterprises for some considerable time. At the turn of the century, however, it launched a massive attempt to provide communal services and utilities itself. Thus, for instance, gas supplies were controlled by the Vienna Imperial Gas Association. This obviously made this new source of energy subject to marked economic restrictions. As early as the 1850s gas was used for improving street lighting. It was not until around 1900 that it was gradually superseded by a new source of energy, electricity. The one construction project that had perhaps the most long-lasting and profound impact on the cityscape was doubtless the regulation of the Danube between 1869 and 1875. The river had formed an extensive criss-cross of branches and backwaters in the Vienna area. Crossing the river was difficult before a system of connecting bridges was established in the late Middle Ages (1439). Ships had access to the city via an arm skirting the inner city in the north. Now an entirely new river bed was excavated, with the former inner city branch forking off as the regulated Danube Canal. Henceforth navigation was on the main river, bypassing the city proper, which subsequently gave growing economic significance to the area between the Danube Canal and the main river. The hopelessly inadequate drinking water supply of the hugely increased urban population was also redesigned from scratch during the second half of the 19th century. The city commissioned the construction of the First Vienna Spring Water Main, to be followed, in the early 20th century, by a Second Vienna Spring Water Main. The system brought fresh spring water from a distance of more than 65 miles from the Alpine foothills south of Vienna, on the borderline between Lower Austria and Styria. It constituted a significant contribution in the interest of public health. And public health continued to be in dire need of improvement: the social situation in the wake of continued industrialization and highly inadequate working conditions further contributed to the misery, so much so that pulmonary tuberculosis acquired the dubious distinction of being called morbus Viennensis. The growth of the urban area combined with the concurrent increase in population figures and the economic change produced a growing divergence between the originally close link between the work and home spheres. It required the government to launch programs for the development of a public transport system. This was a relatively new phenomenon in the urban fabric. But it had been anticipated in some way by interregional transport made possible when steamship navigation and railways emerged. Interestingly enough, the introduction of the first horse-drawn trams in Vienna was motivated by other considerations - to wit, a desire to make the scenic surroundings of Vienna accessible to the people. Soon, however, the new mass transit system became indispensable to large segments of the population. Towards the late 19th century, the so-called metropolitan railway system was built, its lines linking the suburbs. The course of these lines had been made possible by the dismantling of the last remaining fortifications, the above-mentioned Linienwall. Initially, the system was operated with steam and, later on, after World War I, with electricity. The trams had been electrified as early as around 1900. Generally speaking, the construction sector enjoyed a veritable boom in Vienna during the second half of the 19th century. However, it was not spared collapse in some areas, in the wake of the severe economic crisis at the time of the 1873 World Exposition in Vienna. It is interesting to note in this context that housing construction and housing in general was a field entirely controlled by private enterprise. The German term Gründerzeit - literally translated, it means age of the founders - is an appropriate and eloquent description thereof. The tenant was very largely dependent on the private landlord. This resulted in major inadequacies and severe shortcomings. A typical feature of the period was the flat whose kitchen was directly entered from the corridor. It had neither a water tap of its own nor a bathroom or toilet. Running water had to be fetched from the communal tap in the corridor outside the flat, the so-called Bassena, from Italian bacino. The often exorbitant rents gave rise to another social phenomenon, that of the Bettgeher. The tenants of a flat sublet beds for the night/day to people who were unable to afford a flat of their own. This housing situation was particularly widespread in the suburbs, i.e. the districts that were incorporated in 1850. Quite a number of these houses have survived. We also see certain patterns, with some districts having always been associated with the upper echelons of society. Mention should be made here, for instance, of the 4th district, Wieden, with its concentration of embassies or the 8th district, Josefstadt, with a more well-to-do segment of residents of notaries public, lawyers and senior civil servants. Outside the city, in the more rural suburbs, veritable high-quality residential neighborhoods prevailed even as early as the second half of the 19th century. The urban area and the outskirts - they formed part of the province of Lower Austria at the time - converged more and more. Many of the problems were difficult or even impossible to solve for the communities on their own because their fiscal revenue was simply not enough. This situation was perceived as increasingly harmful. The result was another wave of incorporations, this time of communities south of the Danube, from 1890 to 1892. During the first decade of this century (1904), another community, Floridsdorf, became part of Vienna. It lay north of the Danube and had seen a terrific economic upswing, thanks to the machine manufacturing industries located there. Population figures in Vienna had continued to rise rapidly, not only as a result of the incorporations, but also as a result of the massive influx into the capital of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. We have on record the tallies of the regular censuses since 1869. In 1880, the city had had 726,000 inhabitants, by 1890 their number had grown to 1,365,000 - thanks to the incorporation of the suburbs. By 1910 the city reached the highest figure in its history, with 2,031,000. By comparison, London boasted 7.25 million by 1910, Paris 2.85 million and Berlin 2.07 million. This increase went hand in hand with mounting demands on the urban infrastructure which had to be met once again around the turn of the century after the construction of the metro railway system and of the Second Vienna Spring Water Main. Now the city government set about to operate the most important technical services and utilities itself, deprivatising many hitherto private enterprises. This was true in particular of the transport sector as well as the electricity and gas utilities. These programs, which had been intended, among other things, as sources of municipal revenue, triggered a rapid increase of expenditures. Most of the budget was spent (in this order) on education, debt service, roads and streets, general administration, welfare and water supply. It should be noted that all these programs also reflected the profound change that was taking place in terms of more participation in the political life of the country of more segments of the population. The late 19th century had seen a major extension of the right to vote in general - it had been decoupled from tax payments (1907: men's suffrage, 1919: women's suffrage) - as well as, at the same time, the emergence and rise of mass parties. These included in particular the Christian Socialist movement, which was the strongest party until the end of the monarchy in 1918, and the Social Democrats, whose rise began with the end of the First World War. Vienna's very nature as the metropolis of a huge empire proved somewhat problematic during World War I (1914 to 1918), as far as living conditions in the city were concerned. Although not directly confronted with military threats and outright fighting, contrary to World War II, the city suffered terribly and was virtually starved of all supplies. When the war was over and the monarchy had ended in the late autumn of 1918, the former imperial capital of the Habsburg empire had shrunk to the status of the capital of a tiny new country. Vienna's position within this fledgling republic was often described as that of a hydrocephalus. This term highlights not only the concentration of the country's population in the city but also the burden Vienna posed on the young state. Ultimately, in 1921, considerations, not only of a political nature, resulted in the adoption of the so-called Separation Act. This act cut the age-old link between Vienna and the surrounding province of Lower Austria. The city was elevated to the rank of a province in its own right. Beginning in 1918-19, Vienna had a Social Democratic majority. Since a large part of the population was concentrated in Vienna, Lower Austria, although predominantly rural and conservative, also had a Social Democratic government. Therefore, it was chiefly in the interest of the Christian Socialist Party to promote the separation. Once separated from Lower Austria, Vienna embarked on a distinctly Viennese political course. The city became internationally acclaimed model of Social Democratic municipal government in the twenties and early thirties of this century. The popular term when speaking of this period is Red Vienna. Against the background of constitutional changes in Vienna aimed at democratization, radical changes in the revenue and spending policies of the city took place. These changes made the new achievements and programs in the welfare sector possible in the first place. The main focus was municipal housing, which won acclaim beyond Austria's frontiers. The objective was to tackle what had been one of the main problems in the city since the second half of the 19th century and provide, most of all, flats equipped with running water, toilets and adequate supply of natural daylight. Special attention was also paid to providing, in these housing estates, adequate green space and recreation areas. In the years of great economic hardship just after the First World War in particular, attempts were also made to encourage settlement on the periphery. This should give people a possibility to meet some of their needs from the small gardens attached to these homes. For the first time, a real policy of redistribution was implemented, with a little more than half of the local rates being imposed on the wealthy segments of the population. This gave the government some fine successes, even in areas such as education and health care. The backdrop to all this was an increasingly difficult economic situation and - closely linked to it - mounting political radicalization The polarization between the two large political blocs - the Social Democrats and the Christian Socialists - became more and more pronounced. When in July 1927 riots occurred following a miscarriage of justice, a fire broke out in the so-called Justizpalast (Palace of Justice). The spiraling political and economic crisis gained more and more momentum, punctuated by the failure of one of the country's largest banks and by growing unemployment. Then watershed events occurred: In 1933 parliament was dissolved and a few months later, in February 1934, civil war broke out. Subsequently, the democratic constitution was suspended and a period of clerico-fascist authoritarian government (Ständestaat) began. Vienna no longer had an elected legislature either. The new government hoped to create employment by commissioning large-scale projects, mostly road construction projects. These years must take credit for the panorama road snaking up Austria's highest mountain, the Großglockner-Hochalpenstraße, and a similar road in Vienna up the city's small local mountain, Kahlenberg. At the time Austria was practically surrounded by fascist countries in the shape of Germany and Italy. Austria found it increasingly difficult to withstand both the political and the economic pressure. In March 1938, the Anschluß was effected and Austria became part of Hitler Germany. During his first visit to the Vienna Town Hall, Adolf Hitler commented that it was imperative to provide the right setting to this jewel in the crown. However, his policies proved devastating not only for Europe and the world at large, but also for Austria and Vienna. Anti-Semitism, which had been widespread in Vienna for many centuries and had become more prevalent since the turn of the century, eventually combined with the Nazi policy of what ultimately proved to be Jewish extermination. In November 1938 the city's synagogues, the very points of crystallisation of the religious and social life of Vienna's Jewry, fell prey to the destructive fury of a single night's rampaging, in the pogroms of November (Reichskristallnacht). As early as October 1938 the city had seen a tremendous extension of its territory, following the example of Greater Hamburg. 97 Lower Austrian communities were incorporated into Vienna. The number of urban districts increased from 21 to 26. The extension cut deep into the Lower Austrian territory, in all directions, and, at the end of the day, the urban area had tripled. This was the kind of city that experienced the Second World War, which, unlike the earlier war of 1914 to 1918, directly and brutally affected the city and its residents. From 1943 the city suffered repeated Allied bombing. When the war was brought to an end in April 1945 fighting was going on in the very heart of the city. Within days of the end of the fighting, i.e. in April 1945 still, the provisional city government was constituted and the political parties re-emerged. The situation of the city was far from encouraging. More than 20 percent of the housing stock was partly or completely destroyed, almost 87,000 flats had become uninhabitable. In the urban area, more than 3,000 bomb craters were counted, many bridges were in shambles, sewers, gas and water pipes had suffered severe damage. The imperative of the immediate after war period was to solve the most basic problems and get the city back to some degree of working order. The political context was no less complicated. The Allied Occupation Forces refused to accept the Nazis' territorial expansion. The bottom line was that those districts which had existed until 1938 were divided into four Allied zones. The inner-city district was administered by all four powers, as the so-called Inter-allied Zone. Districts 22 - 26, namely the 97 Lower Austrian communities which had been merged with Vienna in October 1938, were considered to form part of Lower Austria and came under Soviet control. In November 1945 the first City Council elections were held in Vienna, and the city was restored to democracy. The 100 seats of the Vienna City Council were divided among the Socialists (58 seats), the People's Party, or Conservatives (36 seats), and the Communists (6 seats). The first and foremost priorities of the new city government were to ensure welfare programs for the young and the elderly, to repair the city-owned utilities and rebuild the city - altogether a program that continued essentially until the early 1960s. As early as 1946 the so-called Territorial Review Act (Gebietsänderungsgesetz) was passed, aimed at more or less repealing the 1938 expansion of the city. Approval by the Allied Occupation Forces was withheld for eight years, since the Soviet forces in particular baulked, so that it did not come into effect until 1954. Since then the urban area has comprised 23 districts. Compared to the pre-1938 situation, the territory that now forms the 22nd district north of the Danube and the 23rd district at the southern extremity of the urban area has been part of Vienna. A year later, in May 1955, the country was restored to freedom through the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag). In Vienna the economy took a decisive turn for the better, not least as a result of assistance granted under the Marshall Plan but also because confiscations of industrial property by the Soviets ceased. The old problems soon gave way to a new set of problems and a new set of demands on the city government. Mention must be made in this context of the growing volume of traffic, especially a dramatic increase in private motorized traffic. Traffic has not been contained even by an extensive development of public transport. In the 1950s and 1960s still, a number of road building programs involved the demolition of historic buildings, the radical clearance of trees along boulevards. These steps began to be more and more in contrast to the growing environmental awareness of the population. In the early sixties the municipal budget reflected a clear refocusing of policies. Greater attention was paid to the extension of public transport and welfare programs, particularly in the health sector. In 1966 the Vienna City Council approved plans for the construction of an Underground system. The first line, running north-south, was opened in 1978. Meanwhile the Underground system has become quite extensive, linking the northern Danube bank with the southern periphery and operating also a very powerful east-west link across the city. In the hospital sector, the landmark event has been the new construction of the Allgemeines Krankenhaus, or General Hospital. Its construction has not been without problems. The philosophy of building huge hospitals of this kind has come under fire, too. Medical care in the neighborhoods north of the Danube has improved dramatically since the completion - at a fairly late point - in the 1990s of the Socio-Medical Centre East. A new awareness has arisen not only with respect to the urban environment. More and more attention has also been paid in recent decades to preserving the priceless architectural heritage of the city. This has resulted in a number of rehabilitation and regeneration programs in the densely built-up old inner-city areas. In this context valuable assistance for certain neighborhoods has also been provided by the Federal Office for Monument Protection, through programs aimed at protecting architectural ensembles. Large building projects which have been launched since 1945/55 have had a dramatic impact on urban development. They have included the redesign virtually from scratch of the Danube riverfront, the first such radical change since 1875. In 1972 new construction programs were embarked upon. A new river bed was excavated in the inundation area, i. e. a wide strip of riverfront on the northern bank, and a man-made island, the so-called Danube Island, created. This made it possible not only to contain the constant threat of flooding but also to open up an entirely new recreation area for the urban population. Closely linked to this redesign of the riverfront is the construction of the UN Centre on the northern bank of the Danube. As early as the 1950s the first of a number of international organizations set up its headquarters in Vienna (1956: IAEO; 1965: OPEC; 1967: UNIDO). With the inauguration of the UN building on the northern bank in 1979 and the International Conference Center a little later, Vienna established itself as one of the three UN headquarters, alongside New York and Geneva. These aforementioned developments of the recent decades have brought the city full circle to its earlier history and its renewed position not only as a supra-regional but also as an international center The chemistry of all this has yet again changed in the recent past. When the Iron Curtain was in place, Vienna served as a bridge between the West and the Communist countries of Eastern Europe. This role became obsolete in 1989. Consequently Vienna's significance has somewhat diminished. The city must now try to hold its ground against such tough competitors as Prague or Budapest. On the other hand, membership in the European Union since 1995 has flung open a new gate, namely the embracing of the country and the city in what was originally an economic and is now an increasingly political community. May we take you back in time for a moment, leaving present-day Vienna and going back to Habsburg and Babenberg times, or even further back to ancient times, when the Romans founded their Vindobona... Archaeological artifacts found in and around the city are evidence of the area having already been populated during Neolithic times (the most famous sculpture is the Venus von Willendorf that dates back to 25000 BC). Favourable climate and fertile soil as well as the near Danube river supported these settlements. A fortified Celtic settlement at the premises of present-day Vienna was  founded around 500 BC and was known as Vedunia. Around 15 BC Vienna came under Roman dominance and was from then on known as Vindobona and dedicated as military camp with an associated civilian town to guard the external borders of the Roman Empire against tribes settling north of the Danube. In 180 BC the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius died in the city during a military campaign. After the Romans had been driven out during the Barbarian invasions in the 5th century, the Langobards seized control of the region, followed by the Slavs and Avars, who in turn were kicked out by the Magyars a couple of decades later. The Magyars were defeated by the Emperor Otto I, the Great, after which the Babenberg dynasty made Vienna their residence within the margraviate Ostarrichi around 1146. The country prospered and was made a duchy in 1156 (Privilegium Minus). In these times the Schottenstift - which is still around these days - was founded. After the death of Friedrich II, the last Babenberg heir in 1246, the country was seized by the Bohemian king Ottokar II. Premysl, who alienated the German nobility with this move. Rudolf I was elected king and defeated Ottokar in the battle of the Marchfeld in 1278, one of the largest knight battles during the Middle Ages, which allowed him to take control over the Austrian lands and established an age-long reign of the Habsburg dynasty. Developing in peaceful times under the Habsburg rule, the city gains reputation with the foundation of the Vienna University (later: Alma Mater Rudolphina) in 1365 by Rudolf IV., which makes it one of the oldest universities in Europe. Vienna eventually became capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1556 after the Habsburgs had gained Hungary and Bohemia. In 1529, Ottoman forces under Suleiman I. the Magnificent laid siege on Vienna, but the attempt to seize the city was thwarted by the outnumbered defenders. In 1683 the City was besieged once again by a large army led by Kara Mustafa. After two months a Polish relief army under Jan III Sobieski was able to defeat the Ottomans decisively in the Battle of Vienna. During the following decades, the Ottoman Empire was pushed back far to the Balcans, thus allowing Vienna to prosper in peace. Substantial building projects were carried out by famous architects such as Fischer von Erlach and Lukas von Hildebrandt. After overcoming extensive visitations of the plague in 1679 and 1713, the city quickly grew to about 200.000 inhabitants by 1790. Vienna was twice seized by Napoleon, first in 1805 without a battle and then in 1809 after a fierce bombing. Shortly after that, the Austrians won the battle of Aspern, but lost at Wagram soon after. After Napoleon's final defeat at Leipzig, the Congress of Vienna (Sep 1814 till Jun 1815) restored the balance of power in Europe. Ignited by the French February Revolution, the Austrian citizens pushed for political power in the March Revolution, which forced the hardliner chancellor Metternich to resign. The following October Revolution in Vienna was crushed by the Emperors armies. Following these events, the Arsenal was erected as defensive barracks against possible uprisings. Shortly after the revolution, the now obsolete fortifications were  demolished and in their place the Ringstraße boulevard was created, featuring a number of monumental buildings. The Danube river was regulated and the Donaukanal constructed. By the turn of the century, the population - consisting of many new immigrants from all parts of the monarchy as well - exceeded 2 millions (Vienna being the 4th biggest city worldwide at that time!). The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, sparked off war in 1914 mainly between the Entente Powers France, UK and Russia versus the Central Powers Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. Finally, the defeat of 1918 was also the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which dissolved into many parts. After the war, the Republik Österreich was proclaimed, consisting of what formerly had been the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The difficult economic situation caused political polarization, which finally led to civil war in 1934. Shortly after, an authoritarian regime (Ständestaat) was established and prevailed without parliamentary approval for the next years. With the invasion of the German army and annexation (Anschluß) by Nazi Germany the state of Austria ceased to exist in March 1938. At first not directly affected by the war started in 1939, the city was bombed by Allied aircraft as of 1943, which led to the construction of large flak towers (anti-aircraft gun blockhouses, still existing). These bombings and the fights prior to the Soviet conquest in 1945 caused heavy destruction within the city.Vienna was divided into occupation zones by the Soviet Union, the USA, the UK and France in 1945. The first free elections were held and reconstruction of the city began. Economy picked up thanks to the Marshal plan. Finally the country was given full sovereignty with the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag) in May 1955. From then on, prosperous times started for the city. Just a few highlights: during the 1970s, Vienna became seat of the United Nations, in the 1980s the first underground was inaugurated and the Donauinsel was built as part of an effective flood protection system serving as recreation area as well. The history of the chapel is not entirely clear. The architecture can be dated to the early 13th century. At this time, Frederick the Warlike (1230-1246), the last Duke of the House of Babenberg, was the ruler of Vienna. It has been hypothesized that the Duke, who would have liked to have established Vienna as an episcopal see, had the crypt built for St. Coloman of Stockerau, who was to be the patron of the new diocese. However, the chronicles do not mention the chapel, which has given rise to the speculation that it is the remnant of a failed project. In the year 1307, a burial chapel of the Viennese family Chrannest is mentioned. The chapel was said to have multiple altars, one of which was dedicated to St. Vergilius of Salzburg. In the Middle Ages, the Stephansdom was encircled by a large cemetery. A single small chapel, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene (the Magdalenskapelle or Magdalene Chapel), existed for consecrations and requiem masses. The Virgilius Chapel lay directly underneath this chapel, and a vertical shaft connected the two buildings. In 1782, the cemetery around the Stephansdom was closed. The Magdalene Chapel was destroyed by fire in 1781 and was not rebuilt (presumably as, without a cemetery, there was no need for a funeral chapel). The Virgilius Chapel was filled with rubble and faded into obscurity. In 1973 the chapel was rediscovered during construction of the Vienna U-Bahn. Today there is a mosaic on the Stephansplatz showing the outlines of the Virgilius Chapel. The chapel itself has survived with hardly any damage and provides the visitor with an excellent glance into the world of the Middle Ages. The Jesuit Church was built between 1623 and 1627 on the site of an earlier chapel, at the time when the Jesuits merged their own college with the University of Vienna's philosophy and theology faculty. The emperor broke ground for both college and church, with the church itself dedicated to Saints Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier. In 1703, Brother Andrea Pozzo, S.J., an architect, painter, and sculptor, and a master in the quadratura, was requested by Emperor Leopold I to redecorate the church. He added twin towers and reworked the façade in an early Baroque style with narrow horizontal and vertical sections. The design of the windows, narrow niches (with statues), and the small central part of the façade deviate from the Baroque style of the towers. Pozzo died unexpectedly in 1709, just before he was to move to Venice, and was buried in the church. After the completion of the work, the church was re-dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. The trunk section is 2.19 m (7 feet 2 inches) tall and is held in place by five iron bands; the iron bears the date 1575 and the initials HB, presumably for Hans Buettinger, the house owner who had the iron replaced. The tree was a forked spruce which started to grow around 1400 and was felled in approximately 1440, as was revealed by examination in 1975. There was regrowth in the middle of the trunk after blows from an axe. The first nails were inserted while the tree was still alive (thus before 1440). The first written mention of it dates to 1533; in 1548 it was already located on the wall of a house in what became Stock-im-Eisen-Platz. The Palais Equitable, which was built on the site in 1891, incorporates the Stock im Eisen in a niche. It stands on a base made of Czech hornblende granite. Wrought iron vines were added, and the building has Zum Stock-im-Eisen (At the Stock im Eisen) carved above the door and a bronze sculpture group of locksmith apprentices and the tree trunk, by Rudolf Weyr, in the tympanum. In addition there are a pair of representations of the legend by the same artist on the doors. The riding school was first named during the Habsburg Monarchy in 1572, long before the French manege of Antoine de Pluvinel, and is the oldest of its kind in the world. Records show that a wooden riding arena was first commissioned in 1565, but it wasn't until 1729 that Emperor Charles VI commissioned the architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach to build the white riding hall used today. Prior to that time, the School operated from a wooden arena at the Josefsplatz. For a time, the riding hall was used for various ceremonies, but it is now open to the public, who may witness the training and performances by the stallions. The Spanish Riding School was named for the Spanish horses that formed one of the bases of the Lipizzan breed, which is used exclusively at the school. Today the horses delivered to the Spanish Riding School are bred at the Piber Federal Stud located near the village of Piber in western Styria, Austria. One of the original studs used to develop the breed was Lipizza, now called Lipica, near Trieste in modern Slovenia, which gave its name to the breed. The Spanish Riding School has antecedents in military traditions dating as far back as Xenophon in Ancient Greece, and particularly from the military horsemanship of the post-medieval ages when knights attempted to retain their battlefield preeminence by shedding heavy armor and learning to maneuver quickly and with great complexity on a firearms-dominated battlefield. Opened on 1 May 1928, the line runs for almost 4 kilometres around the Prater park, an extensive public recreation area in the Austrian capital. A celebration of the centenary of the death of composer Franz Schubert occasioned the original construction of the railway. At its opening it ran for 2 kilometers to the current Rotunda Station. A design of 15 in (381 mm) gauge locomotive was drawn up in 1923 by Chief Engineer Martens of the Munich-based Krauss and Company engineering company, based on a German standard gauge 4-6-2 design, and 20 of these locomotives were built between 1925 and 1950. Three from the second batch were ordered for the Prater Liliputbahn, and two were delivered, and are still operating there today; the order for the third engine was cancelled. The railway was extended in 1933, almost doubling its length. The full running line of 3.95 kilometres is marked throughout at 100 metre intervals with white-painted stone mileposts. In 1938 Freud was forced to leave German-annexed Austria due to his Jewish ancestry, and fled to London. The museum was opened in 1971 by the Sigmund Freud Society in the presence of Anna Freud. In 1996 the building was expanded with new rooms for special exhibitions and events. The Foundation has ongoing plans to expand the museum. Since 1970 the annual Sigmund Freud Lecture has taken place in Vienna on Freud's birthday, 6 May. This event, at which psychoanalysts speak on a contemporary theme, was established by the Sigmund Freud Society and is now organised by the Foundation. The trunk section is 2.19 m (7 feet 2 inches) tall and is held in place by five iron bands; the iron bears the date 1575 and the initials HB, presumably for Hans Buettinger, the house owner who had the iron replaced. The tree was a forked spruce which started to grow around 1400 and was felled in approximately 1440, as was revealed by examination in 1975. There was regrowth in the middle of the trunk after blows from an axe. The first nails were inserted while the tree was still alive (thus before 1440). The first written mention of it dates to 1533; in 1548 it was already located on the wall of a house in what became Stock-im-Eisen-Platz. The Palais Equitable, which was built on the site in 1891, incorporates the Stock im Eisen in a niche. It stands on a base made of Czech hornblende granite. Wrought iron vines were added, and the building has Zum Stock-im-Eisen (At the Stock im Eisen) carved above the door and a bronze sculpture group of locksmith apprentices and the tree trunk, by Rudolf Weyr, in the tympanum. In addition there are a pair of representations of the legend by the same artist on the doors. The Sundial House stands opposite the Schönbrunn Palm House (Palmenhaus; another botanical exhibit), directly between the Hietzing Gate and the Zoo. The unprepossessing building owes its name to the sundial (Sonnenuhr) located in the gardens to the south. It was built with the encouragement of Charles von Hügel – diplomat, explorer and founder of the Vienna Horticultural Society – to replace an earlier greenhouse which could no longer meet its plants' needs. At first it housed the plants of the extensive New Holland Collection which Hügel had assembled, and which had been acquired by the Imperial Court in 1848, and later expanded with plants from southern Africa and the Americas that required similar conditions. The architect of the 1904 building was Alphons Custodis. A bomb attack in February 1945, which almost totally destroyed the windows of the nearby Palm House, left the bulk of the Sundial House's glazing intact, probably because the Palm House stood between it and the bombed area, and because the Sundial House had windows which were roughly parallel to the spreading blast waves (unlike the Palm House). A number of plants from the Palm House were therefore brought here for safekeeping, where space allowed. The Sundial House again served as a refuge between 1986 and 1990, while the Palm House was renovated. In April 1990 the first butterfly zoo in Austria was established in the Sundial House, but it was transferred to the greenhouse in the Burggarten in 1998. Plants in the main hall. Rust on the steel framework caused the building to be closed in 1998 and renovated from 2000 to 2003. The Desert House was finally established here by a joint project between the Zoo and the Austrian Federal Gardens (Bundesgärten), which have managed the building since 1918 as successor to the Imperial and Royal Court Gardens. The exhibition includes succulent plants from the Federal Gardens, and small animals under the care of the Zoo, such as desert jerboas, reptiles and birds. The café was opened in 1876, and in the late 19th century it became a key meeting place of the Viennese intellectual scene. Key regulars included: Peter Altenberg, Theodor Herzl, Alfred Adler, Egon Friedell, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Anton Kuh, Adolf Loos, Leo Perutz, Alfred Polgar and Leon Trotsky. In January 1913 alone, Josip Broz Tito, Sigmund Freud, Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky (the latter two being regulars) were patrons of the establishment. Until 1938 the café was called the Chess school (Die Schachhochschule) because of the presence of many chess players. The Vienna Circle of logical positivists held many meetings before and after World War I. A well known story is that when Victor Adler objected to Count Berchtold, foreign minister of Austria-Hungary, that war would provoke revolution in Russia, even if not in the Habsburg monarchy, he replied: And who will lead this revolution? Perhaps Mr. Bronstein (Leon Trotsky) sitting over there at the Cafe Central?. The café closed at the end of World War II. In 1975, the Palais Ferstel was renovated and the Central was newly opened, however in a different part of the building. In 1986, it was fully renovated once again. Today it is both a tourist spot and a popular café marked by its place in literary history. Café Landtmann was founded by Franz Landtmann on 1 October 1873. Originally from the Währing district, Landtmann came from a family of coffeehouse owners, gingerbread bakers, and fig coffee manufacturers. At the time the original café opened, its Ringstraße location was directly opposite two vast construction sites for the new Town Hall and the new university. Next to the café were the remains of Löwelbastei, where the Burgtheater would later be built. In 1881, Landtmann sold his café to two brothers, Wilhelm and Rudolf Kerl, who continued to run the business under the name Landtmann. After Rudolf retired, Wilhelm ran the café alone and became a local celebrity with prominent figures like Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, and Emmerich Kálmán visiting him regularly. In 1916, after 35 years of running the business, Wilhelm sold Café Landtmann to Karl Kraus, a former butcher and restaurateur. Together with the Hokare Ges.m.b.H. private limited company, Kraus ran the café for five years. Café Landtmann interior. In the fall of 1926, Café Landtmann was purchased by Konrad and Angela Zauner. In 1929, the couple had the coffeehouse expanded and completely renovated, hiring famed architect and professor Ernst Meller, who was responsible for designing numerous Viennese coffeehouses of that time. It was during this renovation that Café Landtmann received its extravagant and lavish interior decorations, which are still preserved to this day, including the four wooden columns at the entrance, sculpted by Hans Scheibner. Following World War II, Konrad turned over the management of the café to his son Erwin, who continued running it successfully until 1976, when it was sold to the Querfeld family. Under the Querfeld family's management, Café Landtmann was completely renovated at significant financial cost in 1982, and then again in 2001 and 2002. On 1 October 1998, for the 125th anniversary of Café Landtmann, the Querfeld family organized a large party attended by celebrities from the political and cultural life of the city, as well as many regular patrons. In 2006, the café's famous head waiter Herr Robert retired after serving there for 29 years. During its long history, Café Landtmann served as a meeting place for many of the leading industrialists, politicians, thinkers, and artists in Austria, and was the preferred coffeehouse of Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, Peter Altenberg, Felix Salten, and Emmerich Kálmán. Café Landtmann is mentioned in James A. Michener's novel Poland, as well as Eva Ibbotson's The Morning Gift. Café Museum was established in a building designed in 1872 by Otto Thienemann. Regular guests of the Café in the early twentieth century included: Peter Altenberg, Alban Berg, Hermann Broch, Elias Canetti, Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Karl Kraus, Franz Lehár, Robert Musil, Leo Perutz, Joseph Roth, Roda Roda, Egon Schiele, Georg Trakl, Otto Wagner and Franz Werfel. The cafe was remodeled in 2003, and no longer retains the interior as designed by Adolf Loos. At the end of 2009 Café Museum was closed until its operation was resumed by Irmgard and Berndt Querfeld in the Summer of 2010. Jacob Ronacher founded the cafe as Café Ronacher in 1880, in a building on the corner of Gumpendorfer Straße and the Lehargasse (Lehar Lane). The decor is reminiscent of Vienna's elegant Ringstraßen-Cafés with parquet floors, bentwood Thonet chairs, marble tables, crystal chandeliers and carambole billiards tables. The building and interior decor were designed by architects Wilhelm Jelinek and Anton Groß. Within the first year of operation, Ronacher sold the establishment to the Sperl family, who renamed the business Café Sperl. In 1884 ownership passed to Adolf Kratochwilla, who retained the cafe's name. Prior to World War I, the primary clientele was an interesting mix of individuals drawn from Vienna's cultural and military circles. In addition to authors, artists, architects, composers, musicians and actors, military officials from the nearby Imperial and Royal (K.u.K) military academy could be found in attendance, including the future Chief of Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf and Archduke Joseph Ferdinand. In 1968 Manfred Staub bought the cafe from the Kratochwillas. He renovated the cafe in 1983. In recent years, the Cafe Sperl has won several awards. These include the Austrian Cafe of the Year, 1998 (German:Österreichischen Kaffeehaus des Jahres) and the Goldene Kaffeebohne (English: Golden Coffee Bean) in 2004. Contemporary cafe regulars have included authors Jörg Mauthe, Robert Menasse and Michael Köhlmeier. The Historic Concert for the Benefit of Widows and Orphans of Austrian and Hungarian Soldiers was held at the Konzerthaus on January 12, 1918. Its patrons were Kaiser Charles and Empress Zita, with posters designed by Josef Divéky. Johann Zacherl began importing insecticide made from pyrethrum from Tiflis in 1842. In 1870, he started to produce moth powder in Unterdöbling, which he sold under the name Zacherl’s insect-killing tincture (Zacherlin). By 1873, the four employees in his factory were already producing 600 tonnes of Zacherlin per year, which were sold in Zacherl’s shops in Paris, Istanbul, Amsterdam, London, New York and Philadelphia. In 1880, Zacherl left the company to his son John Evangelist. The factory in Unterdöbling was rebuilt between 1888 and 1892 to produce insecticide. The street-facing administrative wing of the building, which was designed by Karl Mayreder, is a rare example of commercially-motivated Orientalism in European architecture. The Yenidze cigarette factory in Dresden is another example of this trend. The ceramic tiles that were used in the facade and on the roof of the Zacherl factory were produced by the Wienerberger AG. Johann Evangelist Zacherl expanded the Zacherl company’s activities from the production of insecticide to include the cleaning, repair and storage of fur and rugs. Between 1903 and 1905, he built the Zacherlhaus at the Wildpretmarkt. Following World War I, sales of insecticide were stunted by expensive import taxes and the growth of chemical industries. After Johann Evangelist Zacherl’s death in 1936, his son Gregor Zacherl took control of the family factory, which from 1933 also produced ski bindings, but in 1949 Gregor Zacherl surrendered his merchant’s licence. He died in 1954 and the name Zacherl was deleted from the register of companies in 1958. The factory building and its gardens stood empty for several decades, until in 2006 Veronika and Peter Zacherl, in cooperation with the Jesuit art fund, opened the former factory up for artistic projects. Since then, exhibitions and music soirees have been held in the building every summer. The café was opened in 1876, and in the late 19th century it became a key meeting place of the Viennese intellectual scene. Key regulars included: Peter Altenberg, Theodor Herzl, Alfred Adler, Egon Friedell, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Anton Kuh, Adolf Loos, Leo Perutz, Alfred Polgar and Leon Trotsky.

History The Coronation Evangeliar is the principle work among a small group of manuscripts produced at the court of Charlemagne at Aachen, some time between 794 and late 800.
Architecture The church dedicated to Saint Leopold was built between 1903 and 1907 by the 63-year-old architect Otto Wagner, with mosaics and stained glass by Koloman Moser, and sculptural angels by Othmar Schimkowitz (1864–1947). The great majority of the other smaller details are the work of Otto Wagner himself. The statues on the two external towers represent Saint Leopold and Saint Severin (respectively: they are the two patron saints of Lower Austria) and are the work of the Viennese sculptor Richard Luksch (1872–1936). Unusually the church lies on a North-South axis, at the centre-top of the hospital complex. Otto Wagner incorporated numerous features specifically related to its function within an asylum: e.g. there are very few sharp edges, and most corners are rounded; almost no crosses are visible; the priest's area is potentially entirely separate from the patients'; access to the pulpit is only from the vestry; emergency exits are built into the side walls in case a patient needed to be speedily removed; continuously flowing water replaced holy water stoups at the entrance; there were separate entrances for male and female patients; confessionals were more open than is customary. There were toilet facilities easily accessible within the church in case of patient need. Originally the pews were of different widths to accommodate different categories of patient: calm / restless / disturbed (the latter needing more space). The floor is raked as in a theatre though not as steeply; the fall from entrance to altar is approx. 26 centimetres (10 in): standing at the back the view to the altar is thus less obstructed. The central ceiling below the unseen dome bears images relating to the four evangelists: the man for Matthew, the lion for Mark, the calf for Luke, the eagle for John. The magnificent windows at the sides of the Kirche am Steinhof portray seven saints (named underneath each frame) fulfilling Christ's commands both temporal (feed the hungry, clothe the naked, etc.) and spiritual; with above them a pair of flying angels and a quotation from the Beatitudes. The elaborate and brightly coloured mosaic behind the ornate altar represents the reception of the departed soul into heaven, via an ornate trompe-l'oeil staircase which has been compared unfairly to a Hollywood-style movie award ceremony. Among the numerous saints attending the ceremony is Saint Dymphna the patron saint of those afflicted by epilepsy or mental illness. Also visible is St. Clement Hofbauer or Clemens Maria Hofbauer (1751–1820), the patron saint of Vienna. The dome of the church is not visible from inside the building; even so, the nave has an echo of six seconds. The church, which seats 800 people when full, was reopened on the 1 October 2006, after the completion of the most recent extensive renovation work.
Architecture The Billrothhaus, erected 1892/93 has two floors and five axes. It is a palatial building in the Neo-Renaissance style. The front is rusticated and at the level of the upper floor, arched windows can be found between Corinthian pilasters. An attic style balustrade is arranged on the entire length of the building above the profiled ledge. The balustrade was originally decorated with statues of Apollo, Asklepios, Hygieia and Minerva, made of Loretto stone by the sculptor Anton Pavel Wagner. Beyond a curved entry hall a wooden door with original corroded discs grants access to the building. Another similar door straight ahead leads to the yard, and to the right a stair with handrails between two marble columns leads to a spacious foyer on the elevated ground floor. The foyer and the vestibule are equipped with terrazzo floors. The original porter's lodge is located to the left of the entry hall and behind it, in the backyard section of the building, is a meeting room with old wooden furniture. A richly ornamented niche in the vestibule shows a bust of Emperor Franz Joseph I and on its side walls, a votive table reveals some facts concerning the construction. The sides of the staircase are framed by adjusted pillars and the foyer is decorated with composite pilasters and a stucco ceiling. The reading room on the ground floor is equipped with partially original bookshelves and a gallery with lathed columns. The large, rectangular auditory is located on the upper floor and is circumferentially equipped with a matroneum. The wall is segmented with alternating arches and pilasters. Lunette caps with plaster busts of famous medics are located above them. The coffered ceiling is made of stucco. Two marble busts, Joseph Skoda and Theodor Billroth, are placed on the balustrade. The small conference room is located in the wing facing the backyard; it is richly ornamented with two busts and a painting.
Geography The east of Atzgersdorf is counted among the geological era of Holocene. The west is built on ground originating in the Pannonium, which is a subdivision of the Miocene.
History MU Vienna was founded by the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the foundation of Saudi-Austrian businessman Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber, and built with the support of the City of Vienna and the Vienna Tourist Board. The aim of the founders was to offer students internationally oriented, hands-on studies in the areas of tourism research, information technology, and public administration, making use of the active role of Vienna in European city tourism. Karl Wöber, who had previously taught at the Vienna University of Economics in the field of tourism, was appointed founding president.

History The name Meiselberg is probably a reference to the hill’s steep ridge and most likely derives from the Middle High German meizel (meaning chisel). Today, the hill is sparsely settled, but in contrast to the surrounding hills, is not used for viticulture.
History The first documentary reference to the Schenkenberg dates from 1329 and dubs it in dem Schenkenberge. The name Schenkenberg is probably a reference to the Mundschenk family, which owned land in the area. The Kuenringer, who also owned property in this area, were called the Oberste Schenken. Today, the Schenkenberg is surrounded by numerous vineyards.
History The Vienna Woods have probably been populated since the 8th century. Under the influence of the Avars, a Slavic population settled here after the Völkerwanderung, which may account for village names such as Döbling, Liesing or Gablitz. The Vienna Woods was a princely hunting ground, but from the 16th century onwards forestry was practised. From 1840 industrial development encouraged increased settlement of the area. In 1870, plans were brought forward to clear most of the forest, but this caused widespread public resistance, in which Josef Schöffel was one of the most important figures. In 1987, the governors of the states of Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland signed the Vienna Woods Declaration to protect nature in the region. The film actress Hedy Lamarr, in keeping with her request for when she died, had her ashes spread in the Vienna Woods.

History The first known settlers of this area were Babenberg, in the 11th century. In 1096, the area had been extended by Leopold III to the monastery he founded St. Mary Nivenburg (today Klosterneuburg Abbey). The owners were often changed because the country is often away from the Abbey, has been sold and leased. In the 13th Century, the area was first documented in a chronicle. The Viennese denoted the area as "Werd" (Island). The first settlers in this area were fishermen, hunters and lumbermen. Later, too, settled for gardeners and farmers.
History In 1874, the former settlement of Favoriten was annexed by Vienna as the 10th district. The first district director was the well-known Johann Steudel, who ran a tavern in the former settlement. The district expanded its borders quickly as industries and the associated housing grew in the area. After World War II, Vienna was divided into quarters and split among the Allies, and Favoriten belonged to the Soviet-occupied sector. Favoriten was last expanded in 1954, when the former villages of Rothneusiedl, Oberlaa and Unterlaa were annexed to the district.
Sports Favoriten is home to the stadium of one of the most successful Austrian Bundesliga teams FK Austria Wien, who play at the Generali Arena. Favoriten is also home to a smaller club which came to prominence in the 80's Favoritner AC.

It has won 24 Austrian Bundesliga titles, surpassed only by cross-city rival SK Rapid Wien. With 27 victories in the Austrian Cup and six in the Austrian Supercup, Austria Wien is the most successful club in each of those tournaments. 
Sports The Austrian Football Bundesliga is the highest-ranking national league club competition in Austrian football. It is the competition which decides the Austrian national football champions, as well the country's entrants for the various European cups run by UEFA. Since Austria climbed from nineteenth to fifteenth place in the UEFA association coefficient rankings at the end of the 2011–12 season, the league gained its second spot for the UEFA Champions League.
History In 1954, Liesing was incorporated as the 23rd District, combining 8 former district municipalities: Atzgersdorf, Erlaa, Inzersdorf, Kalksburg, Liesing, Mauer, Rodaun and Siebenhirten. Even before the creation of the district, municipality existed between the old towns of the territory, with various political groupings in the administration. Since the Middle Ages, connections had been noted. Kadolt the Elder from around Eckartsau, in the 14th century, had formed a certain political unity with the places Erlaa, Kalksburg, Mauer and Rodaun. Also the parish Atzgersdorf played a role, up to the Josephine reforms, as a regional religious centre of power for surrounding villages. From there, the Catholic residents of Altmannsdorf, Erlaa, Hetzendorf, Liesing, Mauer, Siebenhirten and partly Kalksburg, while having their own church buildings, did not have their own parishes.
History The former villages of Aspern and Essling are known as the place where Archduke Charles of Austria defeated Napoleon Bonaparte's French army in 1809, at the Battle of Aspern-Essling. On essentially the same ground, Napoleon defeated the Austrian army two months later in the Battle of Wagram, which ended the war in a French victory. The relatively young district (compared to the others, at least) was formed by a resolution of the Vienna Landtag on June 29, 1946. The resolution was supposed to restore the borders between Vienna and Lower Austria. However, due to the occupation by the Russians, the resolution could not immediately take effect. In 1954, the Russians finally accepted the re-districting proposal, and the resolution took effect on July 2, 1954.
Geography The Schenkenberg lies in Obersievering and represents the south-eastern extension of the Pfaffenberg. To the north, the Reisenbergbach separates the Schenkenberg from the Reisenberg; to the south, the Arbesbach divides it from the Hackenberg. The Schenkenberg is part of a north-eastern chain of foothills belonging to the eastern Alps. It is composed of flysch containing quartz, limestone, marl, and other conglomerates.
History Although the Danube river has been inextricably connected with Vienna, for centuries, it had played only a subordinate role in the city of Vienna. Unlike in many other cities, the Danube River, because of the numerous floods it regularly caused, was omitted from the urban area. Buildings grew up in Vienna on both sides of the Danube - but not up to the Danube. Only after extensive flood-control engineering and the creation of the New Danube relief channel, with Danube Island, in the 1970s, was the surrounding cityscape of the Danube of interest to builders. The establishment of Donau City had its origins in the organization of the Vienna International Garden Festival in 1964. This was on a site of a former landfill, later superficially rehabilitated, in an area between the Old Danube and the New Danube. In 1962, the construction of the Danube Tower began, and two years later, the Garden Festival was held. The site of the garden show was known as Donaupark. Not far from Donaupark, in 1967, the planning of the UNO-City was started, opened in 1979. Through the construction of the U1 and the Reichsbruecke (Empire Bridge), the UN-City had a high-ranking access to the traffic system. The terrain gained increasing importance with the opening of the congress center Austria Center Vienna in 1987. Next, at the end of the 1980s, there were plans to hold a Vienna-Budapest EXPO along the northern bank of the Danube in Vienna. However, the planned EXPO 1995 was canceled because a majority of Viennese voters rejected it in a referendum on the project. The site was then developed for a subsequent use as a multifunctional district. In 1991, the EXPO organizing corporation was succeeded by the Vienna Danube Region Development Corporation (WED), with major Austrian banks and insurance companies (BA-CA, Erste Bank, Raiffeisen Bank for Labor and Economy, Invest Bank AG, UNIQA, Wiener Städtische) as principal shareholders. WED owns the area and is responsible for its overall development. Within a few years, the district became a second urban center in Vienna, with residential and office buildings, research facilities, recreational facilities and event locations. Work on the construction of infrastructure for future use began in 1993. The Danube Bank Motorway (A22) was roofed over, providing more area. The foundation for the first building was completed in 1995, with the start of construction of the Andromeda Tower. The total area is 17.4 hectares. Of this total, approximately 1.7 million cubic meters are used for construction, which represents a gross floor area of approximately 500,000 square meters. Nearly two-thirds of those buildings are already completed and utilized.
History The Donauturm was constructed during 1962–1964, as designed by architect Hannes Lintl, in preparation for the Viennese International Horticultural Show 1964. The tower stands at 252 metres (827 ft) in height. Groundbreaking took place on 12 October 1962. After approximately 18 months of construction, under the supervision of Eberhard Födisch, the tower was officially opened on 16 April 1964 by Federal President Adolf Schärf. Since then, it has become a part of the Viennese skyline and has become a popular lookout point and a tourist attraction. It is situated in the middle of the Donaupark, which was built to host the horticultural fair in Vienna's 22nd District, Donaustadt, near the northern bank of the Danube.
History After the Napoleonic War of the Fifth Coalition, the Austrian defeat in the 1809 Battle of Wagram and the Treaty of Schönbrunn, the remaining bastions of Hofburg Palace wer slighted and replaced by a curtain wall with the—still preserved—Outer Castle Gate (Äußeres Burgtor). Inside the Hofburg walls, several squares and gardens were laid out, including the Volksgarten public park. Until the mid-19th century, most of the area of today's Schwarzenberg square was occupied by Vienna's city walls. After the demolition of the city walls in the years from 1858 to 1863, these areas were now available for construction and, similar to the Ringstraßenpalais, magnificent buildings were constructed here in the second half of the 19th century. In 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered the construction of the Schwarzenberg Monument to commemorate the victorious commander of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig, Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. The equestrian statue was created by Ernst Hähnel and completed in October, 1867. Franz Joseph I witnessed the commemoration ceremony of the First Vienna Mountain Spring Pipeline, on 23 October 1873 in front of the Palais Schwarzenberg (in an area that was not yet considered part of Schwarzenberg Platz). In August 1945, immediately after the end of World War II, the Red Army revealed the War Memorial (now popularly called the Russian Monument) behind the Hochstahlbrunnen fountain. Until 1955, a Soviet T-34 tank was placed there. During the occupation, the southern part of square was renamed Stalin Square on 12 April 1946, and this name was officially effective until 18 July 1956. The Haus der Industrie (House of Industry), then No. 4 Stalin Square, was the seat of the Allied Council of the four occupying powers until 1955. In 2003 and 2004, the Schwarzenberg Square was re-designed by Spanish architect Alfredo Arribas and equipped with sunken lighting elements representing different lighting effects. In the course of restructuring, the few green spaces that had existed until then were removed, a matter of much public criticism. There was particularly strong opposition to the replacement of the largely still-existing slim light poles from 1904 by lighting fixtures that were perceived by critics as clumsy and clunky. Under the Schwarzenberg Square courses the Wien River and the underground line U4, and it was also once the location for the Zwingburg, a shelter for homeless people who retreated into the Viennese sewers. 
Geography Vienna is located in northeastern Austria, at the easternmost extension of the Alps in the Vienna Basin. The earliest settlement, at the location of today's inner city, was south of the meandering Danube while the city now spans both sides of the river. Elevation ranges from 151 to 524 m (495 to 1,719 ft). Vienna lies within a transition of oceanic climate and humid continental climate, and features, according to the Köppen classification, a oceanic-climate. The city has warm summers with average high temperatures of 24 to 33 °C (75 to 91 °F), with maximum exceeding 38 °C (100 °F) and lows of around 15 °C (59 °F). Winters are relatively dry and cold with average temperatures at about freezing point. Spring and autumn are mild. Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, averaging 620 mm (24.4 in) annually, with considerable local variations, the Vienna Woods region in the west being the wettest part (700 to 800 mm (28 to 31 in) annually) and the flat plains in the east being the driest part (500 to 550 mm (20 to 22 in) annually). Snow in the winter is not uncommon, but rare compared to Western and Southern regions in Austria. Vienna is composed of 23 districts (Bezirke). Administrative district offices in Vienna (called Magistratische Bezirksämter) serve functions similar to those in the other states (called Bezirkshauptmannschaften); with the exception of the police, which in Vienna is governed by the President of the Police (at the same time one of the nine Directors of Security of Austria), a federal office, directly responsible to the Minister of the Interior. City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that they are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councilor (amtsführender Stadrat). The heart and historical city of Vienna, a large part of today's Innere Stadt, was a fortress surrounded by fields in order to defend itself from potential attackers. In 1850, Vienna with the consent of the emperor annexed 34 surrounding villages, called Vorstädte, into the city limits (districts no. 2 to 8, after 1861 with the separation of Margareten from Wieden no. 2 to 9). Consequently the walls were razed after 1857, making it possible for the city center to expand. In their place, a broad boulevard called the Ringstraße was built, along which imposing public and private buildings, monuments, and parks were created by the start of the 20th century. These buildings include the Rathaus (town hall), the Burgtheater, the University, the Parliament, the twin museums of natural history and fine art, and the Staatsoper. It is also the location of New Wing of the Hofburg, the former imperial palace, and the Imperial and Royal War Ministry finished in 1913. The mainly Gothic Stephansdom is located at the center of the city, on Stephansplatz. The Imperial-Royal Government set up the Vienna City Renovation Fund (Wiener Stadterneuerungsfonds) and sold many building lots to private investors, thereby partly financing public construction works. From 1850 to 1890, city limits in the West and the South mainly followed another wall called Linienwall. Outside this wall from 1873 onwards a ring road called Gürtel was built. In 1890 it was decided to integrate 33 suburbs (called Vororte) beyond that wall into Vienna by 1 January 1892 and transform them into districts no. 11 to 19 (district no. 10 had been constituted in 1874); hence the Linienwall was torn down beginning in 1894. In 1900, district no. 20, Brigittenau, was created by separating the area from the 2nd district. From 1850 to 1904, Vienna had expanded only on the right bank of the Danube, following the main branch before the regulation of 1868–1875, i. e., the Old Danube of today. In 1904, the 21st district was created by integrating Floridsdorf, Kagran, Stadlau, Hirschstetten, Aspern and other villages on the left bank of the Danube into Vienna, in 1910 Strebersdorf followed. On 15 October 1938 the Nazis created Great Vienna with 26 districts by merging 97 towns and villages into Vienna, 80 of which were returned to surrounding Lower Austria in 1954. Since then Vienna has 23 districts. Industries are located mostly in the southern and eastern districts. The Innere Stadt is situated away from the main flow of the Danube, but is bounded by the Donaukanal (Danube canal). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the Danube River. Across the Danube, where the Vienna International Center is located, and in the southern areas are the newest parts of the city (districts 21–23). Austria covers an area of 83,878 square kilometres with a population of 8,443,018 residents (as of 1 January 2012), including 970,541 foreign citizens (11.5% of total population). In 2011, an average of 1,569 million people with migration background lived in Austria, that is 18.9% of the entire population. Vienna is Austria’s most densely populated province with 4,175 residents per square kilometre; the Tyrol is the least densely populated province with 57 inhabitants per square kilometre. In 2010, the average life expectancy was 80 years. Austria is bordered by Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy. Austria is a federal state comprised of nine provinces; each province has its own capital. Burgenland – Eisenstadt, Carinthia – Klagenfurt, Lower Austria - St. Pölten, Upper Austria – Linz, Salzburg – Salzburg, Styria – Graz, Tyrol – Innsbruck, Vorarlberg – Bregenz, Vienna – Vienna. The districts of Vienna (German: Bezirke) are the 23 named city sections of Vienna, Austria, which are numbered for easy reference. They were created from 1850 onwards, when the city area was enlarged by the inclusion of surrounding communities. For federal law, the districts of Vienna do not have the same tasks as the district offices (Bezirkshauptmannschaften) in other parts of Austria, since according to the federal constitution, the whole of Vienna is considered a single district after this definition. The seats of Bezirksvorsteher (political district head) and Bezirksvertretung (district assembly) - both unique in Austria since the districts in the other eight states of the republic are mere administrative bodies—are located in the respective districts, with the exception of the 14th district, whose political representatives reside in the 13th district (to which much of the 14th had belonged until 1938). Since 2002, in Austria, instead of the police the mayors are responsible for objects found in public places. In Vienna, the mayor has ordered the district offices to perform the functions police stations have performed concerning found objects until then. Since 2005, by federal law the districts in all of Austria are responsible for issuing passports and registering residents, tasks until then covered in Vienna by the Federal Police. The mayor of Vienna again has ordered the district offices of the Magistrat to perform these functions. Optimizing overhead costs has gone farther with the Federal Police in Vienna. The 23 District Police Commands in 2002 have been reduced to 14 City Police Commands. Reducing the number of small districts by mergers, as happened in Berlin after the 1990 reunification of Germany, has not even been discussed in Vienna, since the district assemblies function as breeding factories for the political parties' representatives. The following are locations of the 23 districts: Innere Stadt is the city center, with numerous historical sites and few residents. Leopoldstadt is the island between the Danube and the Danube Canal, with Praterstern, Vienna's most frequented traffic spot, and Giant Wheel. Landstraße is on the right bank of the Danube Canal, and includes the Belvedere. Wieden is a small district south of the city center. Margareten was separated from Wieden in 1861. Mariahilf is a small district on the main shopping lane leading to Westbahnhof. Neubau is a small district on main shopping lane leading to Westbahnhof, and includes the Museums Quarter, a large cultural complex. Josefstadt is a small district close to City Hall, Parliament, and Vienna University. Alsergrund is the General Hospital district, and includes Sigmund Freud's residence. Favoriten is in the southern part of Vienna, and has the largest population, the new main train station, and the city's thermal spa. Simmering is on the right bank of the Danube Canal, and includes the Central Cemetery. Meidling is on the southern bank of the Wien river. Hietzing is on the southern bank of the Wien river, and includes Schönbrunn Palace. Penzing is on the northern bank of the Wien river, and was separated from Hietzing in 1938. It includes Otto Wagner's Church Am Steinhof. Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus is on the northern bank of the Wien river. Until 1938, it consisted of the 14th and 15th district and was called Westbahnhof. Ottakring is on the western outskirts and includes Vienna's traditional brewery. Hernals is on the northwestern outskirts of Vienna. Währing is on the northwestern outskirts of Vienna, and includes the Central Institute of Meteorology. Döbling is on the northern outskirts of Vienna, and includes the classical Heurigen district. Brigittenau is on the same island as Leopoldstadt, and was separated in 1900. Floridsdorf is on the right bank of the Danube, and includes industry areas. It is the northernmost part of Vienna. Donaustadt is on the right bank of the Danube, and is the largest district in size. It includes UN City, the largest convention hall in Vienna. Liesing is the southernmost district, and includes industrial areas. Austria is a small, predominantly mountainous country in Central Europe, approx. between Germany, Italy and Hungary. It has a total area of 83,859 km², about twice the size of Switzerland and slightly smaller than the state of Maine. The landlocked country shares national borders with Switzerland (164 km) and the principality of Liechtenstein (35 km) to the west, Germany (784 km) and the Czech Republic (362 km) and Slovakia (91 km) to the north, Hungary to the east (346 km), and Slovenia (311 km) and Italy (430 km) to the south (total: 2563 km). The westernmost third of the somewhat pear-shaped country consists of a narrow corridor between Germany and Italy that is between thirty-two and sixty km wide. The rest of Austria lies to the east and has a maximum north–south width of 280 km. The country measures almost 600 km in length, extending from Lake Constance (German Bodensee) on the Austrian-Swiss-German border in the west to the Neusiedler See on the Austrian-Hungarian border in the east. The contrast between these two lakes – one in the Alps and the other a typical steppe lake on the westernmost fringe of the Hungarian Plain – illustrates the diversity of Austria's landscape. Seven of Austria's nine provinces have long historical traditions predating the establishment of the Republic of Austria in 1918: Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg. The provinces of Burgenland and Vienna were established after World War I. Most of Burgenland had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but it had a predominantly German-speaking population and hence became Austrian. Administrative and ideological reasons played a role in the establishment of Vienna as an independent province. Vienna, historically the capital of Lower Austria, was a socialist stronghold, whereas Lower Austria was conservative, and both socialists and conservatives wanted to consolidate their influence in their respective provinces. Each province has a provincial capital with the exception of Vienna, which is a province in its own right in addition to being the federal capital. In Vienna, the City Council and the mayor function as a provincial parliament and provincial governor, respectively. Café Schwarzenberg is the oldest existing Ringstraße coffee house, opened during the construction of the prestigious boulevard in 1861 by a married couple with the family name Hochleitner. It quickly became an important meeting place for influential entrepreneurs and financiers. Among the famous frequent guests was the architect Josef Hoffmann (1870–1956), one of the founders of the artistic Wiener Werkstätte manufacturing company. Many of Hoffmann's designs were drafted at Café Schwarzenberg. After World War II in Allied-occupied Austria, the Soviet Red Army used the space as an officers' mess for various events. As a result of this the decor was damaged by gunfire, the results of which were apparent as late as 1979. Café Schwarzenberg was run by the Österreichisches Verkehrsbüro travel company until 1 January 2008, when it was purchased by the Austrian Vivatis food company. Today Café Schwarzenberg with its Schanigarten on the Ringstraße sidewalk is a popular spot with both tourists and locals. As well as hosting a wide variety of cultural events such as readings and concerts, it hosts Kaffeehausmusik (Coffee House Music) on several evenings during the week. In the Viennese ball season, the Cafe Schwarzenberg is one of the few cafés to offer early morning goulash and beer breakfasts for the ball attendees. The Donauturm was constructed during 1962–1964, as designed by architect Hannes Lintl, in preparation for the Viennese International Horticultural Show 1964. The tower stands at 252 metres (827 ft) in height. Groundbreaking took place on 12 October 1962. After approximately 18 months of construction, under the supervision of Eberhard Födisch, the tower was officially opened on 16 April 1964 by Federal President Adolf Schärf. Since then, it has become a part of the Viennese skyline and has become a popular lookout point and a tourist attraction. It is situated in the middle of the Donaupark, which was built to host the horticultural fair in Vienna's 22nd District, Donaustadt, near the northern bank of the Danube. 
Sports The first successful athletes were the Meidling Weightlifting, founded in 1884 as the "First Meidlinger athletes club" and for a long time, the most successful weightlifting club in Austria. Wilhelm Türk reached ten world records and was the 1898 world championship. Founded in 1906, the Sportclub Wacker was the first football/soccer club in Meidling. The club has won a championship and 1947 Cup Final; however, in 1973 it was merged with the club for FC Admira Wacker / Admira.
Sports IFIUS (International Federation for Interuniversity Sport) was a democratic non profit organisation whose main objective was to organise the yearly World Interuniversity Games, in which teams of students from different Universities and Colleges worldwide competed in different sport competitions. In 2011, IFIUS was disbanded and integrated inside Panathlon.
Sports The World Interuniversity Games is an international sport event, which was organised by IFIUS (International Federation for Interuniversity Sport) each year in October. It is currently organised by Committee Panathlon Clubs of Universities, after IFIUS was disbanded and integrated inside Panathlon International in 2011.
History Several forerunners were built in the Palace Park in the 18th and 19th centuries, under Emperors Francis I and Joseph II. The present building was opened in 1882, under Franz Joseph I. Since 1918 it has been run by the Bundesgärten (Federal Gardens). Tree-shaped cast iron column. A heavy bomb attack on Schönbrunn Palace in February 1945 destroyed most of the glazing of the Palmenhaus. Many plants died, although some were saved by being transferred to the nearby Sonnenuhrhaus. The rebuilding began in 1948, and the Palmenhaus was reopened in 1953. The building was closed to the public in 1976 as a safety measure following the collapse of the Reichsbrücke. Renovations were carried out between 1986 and 1990.
History The name Wieden was first recorded in 1137, and is thus the oldest Vorstadt (former municipality within the Linienwall) of Vienna. The main street (Wiedner Hauptstraße) is certainly even older. The district was the site of the former royal Summer residence, which was completed under Ferdinand II, and was expanded many times until Maria Theresa sold it to the Jesuits. Today it is the Theresianum, a prestigious private boarding school, while the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna resides in a wing of the building. In the beginning of 18th century, the development of Wieden as a suburb began. Many palaces and other buildings were built. Two small Vorstädte in the area of the present fourth district were Hungelbrunn and Schamburgergrund. These three areas along with a number of others were incorporated into the city of Vienna as the fourth district on March 6, 1850. Because of social and economic differences, Margareten was separated from the fourth district to form the fifth district in 1861. The so-called Freihaus, built in 1700 and the largest apartment building/tenement of the time, was located in this area, although by 1970 its state had deteriorated. The name has been rehabilitated in recent years to give an identity to the local bars, restaurants and independent retailers. During the occupation by the allies (1945–1955), Wieden was part of the Soviet sector of Vienna.
Geography The Vienna University of Technology is located in this district with its main administration buildings being located in Karlsplatz and a nearby satellite campus in the 6th district across the Wienzeile.
History After the second Turkish siege of Vienna, the villages of Reindorf, Braunhirschen, and Rustendorf arose and were in 1863 combined into the municipality of Rudolfsheim, named after the Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. In the nineteenth century, the district grew significantly, and in 1890 was incorporated along with nearby communities Fünfhaus and Sechshaus into Vienna proper. The northern and eastern parts of Fünfhaus became the fifteenth district and the area of Rudolfsheim and Sechshaus became the fourteenth district under the name of Rudolfsheim alone. In 1938 Rudolfsheim and Fünfhaus were unified into the 15th district, and the 14th district became the part of the 13th district north of the Wien River. Since 1957, the 15th district has been named Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus. From 1871 to 1938, there had been the synagogue on Turner Street, but during the November Pogrom Kristallnacht, it was destroyed, along with 91 other Viennese synagogues. Only the City Temple in the 1st District survived the night unscathed. In the 1990s, there were several small changes in district boundaries. In 1992, the boundaries were altered in the area of the Auer-Welsbach Park. In 1995, the district boundaries changed in two sections of the belt, and in the field Kendlerstraße, Sporckplatz and Ibsenstraße. The most recent change was marginal in 1996 in the area of Europe square in front of the Western Railway Station. These border changes were not in residential areas, but especially at transport buildings, parks and sports facilities.
History The Rathaus was designed by Friedrich von Schmidt in the Gothic style, and built between 1872 and 1883. On the top of the tower is the Rathausmann, one of the symbols of Vienna. Facing the Rathaus is a large park, the Rathauspark. The Rathaus also accommodates the historic 'Wiener Rathauskeller' restaurant. The traditional restaurant consists of several baroque halls, offering small traditional Viennese delicacies to grand gala buffets.
Geography The Donaustadt district is in the northeast part of Vienna and is the largest of the districts in area, occupying about one-quarter of the Vienna city area, 102.24 km². It borders the 2nd District, (Leopoldstadt), the 11th District, (Simmering), and the 21st District, (Floridsdorf) as well as parts of Lower Austria. The district has a large part to the west of the Danube, Danube Island and Old Danube. In the east and north, Donaustadt shares the Marchfeld. Overall, about 59 percent of the district's territory is in green areas, making 30 percent of Vienna's green space lie in the 22nd District. By Danube regulation, in 1870-75, the territory of the present district was radically changed. The Danube had originally spread out in numerous arms, so she was now forced in a wide bed. As the flood threat has not been fully defused, during 1972 to 1987, a side channel (as the "New Danube") was built parallel to the river, creating the long, thin Donauinsel (Danube Island) between the Danube and the New Danube. The former Danube flood plain is now controlled in the 4 branches, or fingers, of the river, as they separate and then rejoin, all within Vienna, along the southwest edge of Donaustadt. The 4 branches are (from west to east): the Danube Canal (German: Donaukanal), the main Danube, the New Danube (Neue Donau), and the Old Danube (Alte Donau).
Geography The district of Hernals stretches out along the canals of the Als River west of Vienna between the Wienerwald (Vienna Forest) and the Gürtel (a main street around inner Vienna). The Als is the second-longest stream (the longest is the Wien River) to flow from the Wienerwald into the Danube. The highest point, at 464 meters, is Heuberg. The original Vororte of Hernals, Dornbach, and Neuwaldegg were annexed in 1892 and form the heart of the 17th district. The houses in the central areas were built around the turn of the 19th–20th centuries during the Gründerzeit. Further out, the original farmer houses remain, often with gardens and villas added on. Farmland composes about 29.7% of the land area of the district, and transportation support buildings compose about 10.3% of the area. With about 59.6% of the area populated with greenery, Hernals is one of the greenest districts in Vienna, with 39.6% forest and 14% smaller gardens and meadows. Agriculture composes only 1.4% and plays little role today. The wineries have mostly retreated into the hills of Schafberg and belong to the Roman Catholic parish of Dornbach.
History Opened on 1 May 1928, the line runs for almost 4 kilometres around the Prater park, an extensive public recreation area in the Austrian capital. A celebration of the centenary of the death of composer Franz Schubert occasioned the original construction of the railway. At its opening it ran for 2 kilometers to the current Rotunda Station. A design of 15 in (381 mm) gauge locomotive was drawn up in 1923 by Chief Engineer Martens of the Munich-based Krauss and Company engineering company, based on a German standard gauge 4-6-2 design, and 20 of these locomotives were built between 1925 and 1950. Three from the second batch were ordered for the Prater Liliputbahn, and two were delivered, and are still operating there today; the order for the third engine was cancelled. The railway was extended in 1933, almost doubling its length. The full running line of 3.95 kilometres is marked throughout at 100 metre intervals with white-painted stone mileposts.
Geography The district of Ottakring is located in the western part of Vienna between the Gürtel (a substantial road around Vienna) and the hills of the Wienerwald (Vienna forest). The district of Hernals borders to the north, Josefstadt and Neubau to the east, and Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus and Penzing to the south. The highest points in the district are the Gallitzinberg (449 m), also known as Wilheminenberg because a palace (Schloss Wilheminenberg) is situated on its slope. The buildings vary considerably in style. The working class settled around the industries and factories near the Gürtel, resulting in a dense checkerboard pattern of residential housing. A little further up is a collection of villas around the Ottakring cemetery surrounded by an extensive number of deciduous trees. The district is made up of 36.7% green space (of which 22% is forest), 45.4% buildings, and 17.9% transportation. Thaliastraße is the busiest and most commercially important street in the district. A total of 1.23% of the land area is used for agriculture. The once important vineyards have mostly disappeared. Gardens are found primarily around castle Wilhelminenberg and towards the border to Penzing.
Geography The district area of Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus was, during the Mesozoic Era, near a sea that retreated 70 million years ago and gradually formed an inland sea. After the final retreat of the sea occurred during the Ice Age, large masses of debris formed from glaciers, mainly from the Danube, but also the Vienna River in the Vienna Basin. In the warm phase, the Danube and Vienna River cut into the land and formed gravel terraces, with the older terraces being at increasing distance from the waters. Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus is located in the oldest terrace (Laaerbergterrasse) supported by Laaerberg on Gloriette from the melting of the Turks and hill ranges. In this section, the terrace Wiental lies, which was once covered by the melting to Gloriette. Through the ever-receding water levels, the height sections remained for the current district area. The top soil layer in the district territory consists of a thin layer of loess, which is mixed with limestone and sandstone gravel from the Vienna Woods. Among them are layers of river gravel, mainly quartz, coming from the Alps. Below this gravel are the relics of the freshwater sea that a layer of sand, gravel and Tegel deposited. The district area rises from south to north and from east to west. The lowest area of the district territory is located at the intersection of Sechshauser Belt and Ullmannstraße with an elevation of 184 metres (604 ft). The highest point is at the crossing John Street and Road Hütteldorfer with an elevation of 240.6 metres (789 ft). The developed area of Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus comprises 52.8% (Vienna city-wide 33.3%) of the District area. Nearly 81.0% of the developed area is accounted for by residences, bringing the district in the upper part of the Vienna districts. Farmland includes a share of 8.2% of the area. Cultural, religious, sporting or public buildings share 10.6% of the area. Nearly 33.5% of the district is in traffic/transportation areas. This is the third highest value of a municipality of Vienna.By contrast, the proportion of grassland in the district is rather small: 12.7%. About half of the green areas are parks, 31.2% attributable to small gardens, with 18.5% as outdoor sports and recreation areas. A final 1.0% is water, i.e. the river bed of the Vienna River.
Geography Währing covers 6.28 km2 in northwestern Vienna on the slopes of the Wienerwald between the Gürtel and the Höhenstraße. The district ascends from the steep banks of the (now channeled and enclosed) Währinger Stream on both sides. It is bordered to the north by the 19th District (Döbling), to the east by the 9th District (Alsergrund) and to the south and west by the 17th District (Hernals). Währing comprises 53.6% built-up areas (compared to 33.2% Vienna-wide), of which 92.83% are residential. Green space occupies 30.2% of the district: woodland 14.4%, parkland 7.9%, meadows 3.0%, allotments 2.9%, sports fields 1.3% and agriculture (vineyards) 0.6%. Third come transport areas, which make up 16.2% of the total land area.
Geography Margareten is in the southwest of Vienna and is bounded to the north by the Vienna River, in the west and south by the Gürtel belt. The Vienna River is also the border to the district Mariahilf, while the belt is the boundary of the districts Favoriten and Meidling. The eastern district boundary with Wieden runs contrary to the other inner districts in the transverse rather than longitudinal. Thus, the district boundary follows the streets: Kettenbrückengasse, Margaretenstraße, Kleine Neugasse, Mittersteig, Ziegelofengasse, Blechturmgasse until the Gürtel belt. Margareten is the only district within the Vienna Belt which is not within the Inner City borders. The district area is part of the Katastralgemeinde Margareten, which has a hectare of the territory of the neighboring district Mariahilf. The lowest point in Margareten is nearly 174 metres (571 ft) in the Wiental. In the south (at Wienerberg hill), the land rises slightly. Margareten has no sharp altitudes, or mountains: the total height difference is approximately 30 metres (98 ft).
Geography The 12th District lies in southwest Vienna, about 5–10 km (3–6 mi) from the Innere Stadt. It stretches from Wiental south of the Vienna River in the regioan between the Wienerberg hill in the 10th District and the Grünen Berg hill, of Schönbrunn Castle in the 13th District.  The former suburb, after which the "Meidlinger L" of the South-Viena dialect is named, consists of two parts: a heavily developed workers section, closer to the downtown area (Obermeidling, Untermeidling and Gaudenzdorf); and a loose joint area (and Altmannsdorf Hetzendorf), to the southwest. The latter is a mixed industrial and residential area to the Valley of the Liesing, where the compound structure of the 23rd District continues. In between, are the foothills of the mountain with its Viennese geologically young beach terraces and brick pits. Besides the Katastralgemeinden of Altmannsdorf, Gaudenzdorf, Hetzendorf and Meidling (Obermeidling and Untermeidling), there are also small areas of the Katastralgemeinden Atzgersdorf, Inzersdorf and Inzersdorf City in the Meidlinger district area. A breakdown of the district area is also in the Zählbezirken official statistics, in which the municipality Zählsprengel combined. The eleven census-districts in Meidling are: Gaudenzdorf, Fuchsenfeld, Meidlinger Friedhof, Wilhelmsdorf, Meidlinger Hauptstraße, Tivoligasse, Gatterhölzl, Oswaldgasse, Am Schöpfwerk, Altmannsdorf und Hetzendorf. Despite partial name similarity, the boundaries of the census-districts do not match those of each Katastralgemeinde.
Geography The Arbesbach, which makes its way through the Wienerwald, is characteristic for streams in low mountainous areas (Mittelgebirge). Because the ground does not absorb much rainfall, the level of water in the stream can change rapidly when it rains heavily, resulting in flash flooding. The Arbesbach rises in the woods and runs over relatively steep ground that has been heavily eroded. Several springs in the area between the Dreimarkstein and the Latisberg flow together to form the headwaters of the Arbesbach. The most northerly springs rise to the south of the Jägerwiese and between the Latisberg and Vogelsangberg. These meet to the north of the Hartgrabenwiese and are quickly joined by another three springs, which rise at Am Himmel (Pfaffenberg) and to the south of the Rohrerwiese. The Arbesbach flows from this point onward along the left-hand side of the Sieveringer Straße. The most easterly tributary, the Gereutebach, rises to the east of the Dreimarkstein and runs along the Spießweg before flowing into the Arbesbach at the point where the stream crosses to the right-hand side of the road to run between it and the Spießweg. From the point at which it reaches the Gspöttgraben in Obersievering, the Arbesbach is partially enclosed. From number 223 in the Sieveringer Straße onwards, the stream still follows its own course, but it is almost entirely enclosed. Just past the Agnesgasse (at number 168 in the Sieveringer Straße), the Arbesbach empties into a canal behind the row of houses on the side of the street with odd house numbers. The canal is 1.3 metres wide and 1.8 metres deep. Originally, the Arbesbach continued along this side of the street as far as the Sievering parish church, where it turned off behind the right-hand line of houses before diagonally crossing to the opposite side of the street again at the Brechergasse. Thereafter, the stream flowed past the former Helenenbad near the Schatzlsteig towards the Windhabergasse and then carried on where there is now a footpath between the Windhabergasse and the Sieveringer Straße. Upon reaching the Börnergasse, the Arbesbach finally left the main street and turned into the Gräfweg. From there, its course took it along the Arbesbachgasse, which is named after the stream. It continued in a line from here to empty into the Krottenbach below the former private lunatic asylum.
Geography Leopoldberg forms the northeastern corner of the Alps. Alternating layers of marl (rich in carbonate) and sandstone form the parent rock. Unlike most of the mountains of the flysch zone (Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary periods), the Leopoldsberg has steep slopes due to the erosive power of the river Danube on one side and of a small creek on the other. This relief intensifies the differences in local climate and vegetation, which are provided by the borderline between Pannonic and Central European climates. The northern slope is covered with beech forests, the most common forest type of the Wienerwald.
Geography The highest elevation in the Vienna Woods is Schöpfl at 893 metres (2,930 ft) above sea level, the location of the Leopold Figl observatory. Important rivers in the Vienna Woods are the Wien, the Schwechat and the Triesting. The northeasternmost Leopoldsberg overlooking the Danube and the Vienna Basin forms the eastern end of the Alpine chain. Even though the Vienna Woods are a protected landscape and important recreational area, they are threatened by urban sprawl. The Lainzer Tiergarten, an extensive park populated by wild boar and other woodland animals, as well as the Schwarzenbergpark, were created on the territory of the city of Vienna during the 19th century. The natural park Sandstein-Wienerwald is near Purkersdorf, some 20 km (12 mi) west of Vienna. There are also some caves, such as the Dreidärrischenhöhle ("cave of the three deaf men").
History Jacob Ronacher founded the cafe as Café Ronacher in 1880, in a building on the corner of Gumpendorfer Straße and the Lehargasse (Lehar Lane). The decor is reminiscent of Vienna's elegant Ringstraßen-Cafés with parquet floors, bentwood Thonet chairs, marble tables, crystal chandeliers and carambole billiards tables. The building and interior decor were designed by architects Wilhelm Jelinek and Anton Groß. Within the first year of operation, Ronacher sold the establishment to the Sperl family, who renamed the business Café Sperl. In 1884 ownership passed to Adolf Kratochwilla, who retained the cafe's name. Prior to World War I, the primary clientele was an interesting mix of individuals drawn from Vienna's cultural and military circles. In addition to authors, artists, architects, composers, musicians and actors, military officials from the nearby Imperial and Royal (K.u.K) military academy could be found in attendance, including the future Chief of Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf and Archduke Joseph Ferdinand. In 1968 Manfred Staub bought the cafe from the Kratochwillas. He renovated the cafe in 1983. In recent years, the Cafe Sperl has won several awards. These include the Austrian Cafe of the Year, 1998 (German:Österreichischen Kaffeehaus des Jahres) and the Goldene Kaffeebohne (English: Golden Coffee Bean) in 2004. Contemporary cafe regulars have included authors Jörg Mauthe, Robert Menasse and Michael Köhlmeier. 
History Café Schwarzenberg is the oldest existing Ringstraße coffee house, opened during the construction of the prestigious boulevard in 1861 by a married couple with the family name Hochleitner. It quickly became an important meeting place for influential entrepreneurs and financiers. Among the famous frequent guests was the architect Josef Hoffmann (1870–1956), one of the founders of the artistic Wiener Werkstätte manufacturing company. Many of Hoffmann's designs were drafted at Café Schwarzenberg. After World War II in Allied-occupied Austria, the Soviet Red Army used the space as an officers' mess for various events. As a result of this the decor was damaged by gunfire, the results of which were apparent as late as 1979. Café Schwarzenberg was run by the Österreichisches Verkehrsbüro travel company until 1 January 2008, when it was purchased by the Austrian Vivatis food company. Today Café Schwarzenberg with its Schanigarten on the Ringstraße sidewalk is a popular spot with both tourists and locals. As well as hosting a wide variety of cultural events such as readings and concerts, it hosts Kaffeehausmusik (oCoffee House Musico) on several evenings during the week. In the Viennese ball season, the Cafe Schwarzenberg is one of the few cafés to offer early morning goulash and beer breakfasts for the ball attendees.
Architecture Architecture has to do with planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology, and of light and shadow. Often, conflicting requirements must be resolved. The practise of Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimation and construction administration. Documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, defines the structure and/or behavior of a building or other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed. The notable 19th-century architect of skyscrapers, Louis Sullivan, promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: Form follows function. While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of function in place of Vitruvius' utility. Function came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of a building, not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural. Sydney Opera House, Australia designed by Jørn Utzon. Nunzia Rondanini stated, Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing values, architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and of itself, it will promote social development.' To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art's sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality. Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are rationalism, empiricism, structuralism, poststructuralism, and phenomenology. In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of sustainability, hence sustainable architecture. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management and lighting. Around the beginning of the 20th century, a general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern Architecture. Notable among these is the Deutscher Werkbund, formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, the Bauhaus school, founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis—the apex—of art, craft, and technology. When Modern architecture was first practiced, it was an avant-garde movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after World War I, pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms. Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright developed Organic architecture, in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being Robie House and Fallingwater. Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the International Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center. Many architects resisted Modernism, finding it devoid of the decorative richness of ornamented styles and as the founders of that movement lost influence in the late 1970s, Postmodernism developed as a reaction against its austerity. Postmodernism viewed Modernism as being too extreme and even harsh in regards to design. Instead, Postmodernists combined Modernism with older styles from before the 1900s to form a middle ground. Robert Venturi's contention that a decorated shed (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside) was better than a duck (an ungainly building in which the whole form and its function are tied together) gives an idea of these approaches. Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability. The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism, have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal philosophical or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences. Environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with profound affect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright, in the 1960s by Buckminster Fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg and Sim Van der Ryn in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques. The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this. Concurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. An architectural style is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable. A style may include such elements as form, method of construction, building materials, and regional character. Most architecture can be classified as a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible. Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of architectural history. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. The new style is sometimes only a rebellion against an existing style, such as post-modernism (means after modernism) which has in recent years found its own language and split into a number of styles with other names. Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. For instance, the Renaissance began in Italy around 1425 and spread to all of Europe over the next 200 years, with the French, Belgian, German, English, and Spanish Renaissance being recognisably the same style, but with unique characteristics. A style may also spread through colonialism, either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. One example is the Spanish missions in California, brought by Spanish priests in the late 18th century and built in a unique style. After a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, classicism has been revived many times and found new life as neoclassicism. Each time it is revived, it is different. The Spanish mission style was revived 100 years later as the Mission Revival, and that soon evolved into the Spanish Colonial Revival. Vernacular architecture works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded by new technology and national building standards. If you take an early-morning stroll along Vienna’s Danube Canal, you not only enjoy the first rays of sun; you also gain a strong sense of the unique coexistence of nature, youthful creativity and the legacy of Vienna’s most important architect. On the left the waters of the canal murmur softly on their way to the Black Sea, while on the right the colorful graffiti on the stone retaining walls glows in the morning sun. And along this path you also make your first acquaintance with the legacy of the famous Jugendstil architect Otto Wagner: the Rossauer Lände and Friedensbrücke underground stations were built at the beginning of the twentieth century according to designs by this famous city planner. They also ensure quick access to the city center. Vienna’s historic downtown is remarkable for its harmonious coexistence of traditional and modern architecture: here historic buildings and contemporary structures blend together to create an impressive, inimitable cityscape. A good example of this is the Gothic St. Stephen’s Cathedral, which directly faces the modern, glass-and-steel Haas Haus building. Then there is the Hofburg Palace, the splendid former seat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire: right across the square is the Looshaus, completed in 1911 and a landmark of modern Viennese architecture. Not far from here is also the world-famous Vienna State Opera, whose neighboring buildings include the Albertina. This museum not only boasts one of the world’s largest collection of graphic art; it is also striking for its Soravia Wing, a remarkable glass-and-steel structure that serves as a fly roof. The imperial past is still palpable when one strolls past the Kunsthistorisches Museum (Museum of Art History) and the Naturhistorisches Museum (Museum of Natural History) on the way to the nearby MuseumsQuartier, which represents a very special combination of history and zeitgeist. Contemporary architecture has filled this complex, which 100 years ago was still used as the court stables, with new life. Now the courtyard has the feeling of a modern, urban living room, ringed by historic and modern buildings such as the Leopold Museum and the Museum Moderner Kunst. All of this has made the Museums Quartier one of the liveliest spots in all of Vienna, drawing locals as well as visitors who come here to relax, chat and enjoy the evening sun. The area around Karlsplatz is a melting pot of various building cultures: the Secession, situated on the Wienzeile, is the city’s most important Jugendstil buildings, while the Baroque Karlskirche, located directly on Karlsplatz, provides a fascinating stylistic contrast to the Neoclassical architecture of the world-famous Musikverein, right across the road. architecture in Vienna. The fact that Vienna is the meeting place of so many different cultures can be explained by the city’s glorious history. Many grand buildings are the legacy of the Habsburg Empire, including two particularly imposing palaces. Schönbrunn Palace served as the summer residence of emperors, and Empress Sisi in particular was fond of strolling through the splendid palace grounds. The gardens of the Baroque Belvedere Palace, built as the summer residence for Prince Eugene of Savoy, are striking for their tiered fountains and sculptures. Those who prefer more contemporary architecture will want to head across the river to the Donau City, also known as Vienna DC. The architecture of this new neighborhood is characterized by glass-and-steel towers jutting high into the sky. At the end of a long tour of cultural sights, one looks forward to spending a relaxing evening enjoying a glass of wine. And there is no better place for this than Vienna, which has the privilege of having its very own vineyards and thus also its very own wines, made at wine estates boasting some of the city’s most innovative architecture. The Historicism on the Ringstrasse and the buildings by Jugendstil architect Otto Wagner are prominent architectural styles of the city. The Kirche am Steinhof (St. Leopold Church) and the Post Office Savings Bank building are key turn-of-the-century structures. Wagner’s contemporary Adolf Loos, also a pioneer of Modernist architecture, shocked the Viennese public with the bare facade of his building on Michaelerplatz and is also responsible for the interior design of the charming American Bar. The revolutionary designs of the Austrian star architect Hans Hollein caused a furore in the 1960s. They can be seen in the former Retti candle shop on Kohlmarkt, now the jewellers Yana Gadner. And since 1990 St. Stephan’s Cathedral has been reflected in the glass façade of the Haas House on Stephansplatz, also planned by Hollein. The building boom continued with the Wienerberg City and its Twin Towers by Massimiliano Fuksas. Architect Zaha Hadid designed an apartment block on stilts on Spittelauer Lände. And in 2001 Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au, Manfred Wehdorn and Wilhelm Holzbauer transformed the distinctive gasometers, huge 19th century gas holders that can be seen on the way to and from the airport, into an extravagant housing, event and office location.Vienna is a breathtaking city, not least because of its marvellous architecture. During the reign of Empress Maria Theresa (1740-80) and her son Joseph II (1780-90), major architects like Johann Lukas von Hildebrand and Josef Emanuel Fischer von Erlach formed the city face with their magnificent buildings. Majestic Karlskirche was planned and executed by Fischer von Erlach. The time of the Congress of Vienna (1814-15) and the second half of the 19th century brought another great change in Vienna's architecture. Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered the restructuring of Ring boulevard. Famous Baroque architects like Gottfried Semper and Karl von Hasenauer contributed to turning Vienna into one of the most exciting cities of Europe. They collaborated at the Museum of Fine Arts and semper is responsible for majestic State Opera House. The turn of the 19th century brought one of the most fascinating chapters of Austrian art history: art deco or 'Jugendstil' as it is called in Vienna. Otto Wagner was one of the major influences and is till today highly visible in Vienna's city face. The great architect is responsible for Vienna's tube network. The network was extended till then, but his influence is still visible in many tube stations. Other achievements include Majolica house at the 'Naschmarkt' and the spectacular 'Postsparkasse' in the first district. One of his pupils, Joseph Maria Olbricht, realized an exciting art deco museum: Secession building with its cupola of golden laurel leaves. Adolf Loos established a very rational and minimalistic style of architecture.  But Vienna does not only bewitch with its traditional buildings. Modern structures, too, adorn the modern Austrian capital and some of Austria's architects have influenced international architecture. Friedensreich Hunderwasser introduced a highly original style with his aversion against straight lines and his fondness of color. In Vienna you can admire some of his mastepieces: famous 'Hundertwasserhaus', 'KunstHaus Wien' or the waste combustion at Spittelau. Hans Hollein's glass and concrete 'Haas House' at the very center of the first district just opposite of 'St. Stephen' scandalized a major part of Viennese population. An Austrian group of architects has impressed the world with their agravic architecture:Coop Himmelb(l)au have realized a number of buildings in Vienna and all over the world. Their adaption of one of the four gasometer buildings is spectacular. A variety of architectural styles can be found in Vienna, such as the Romanesque Ruprechtskirche and the Baroque Karlskirche. Styles range from classicist buildings to modern architecture. Art Nouveau left many architectural traces in Vienna. The Secession, Karlsplatz Stadtbahn Station, and the Kirche am Steinhof by Otto Wagner rank among the best known examples of Art Nouveau in the world. Concurrent to the Art Nouveau movement was the Wiener Moderne, during which some architects shunned the use of extraneous adornment. A key architect of this period was Adolf Loos, whose works include the Looshaus (1909), the Kärntner Bar or American Bar (1908) and the Steiner House (1910). The Hundertwasserhaus by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, designed to counter the clinical look of modern architecture, is one of Vienna's most popular tourist attractions. Another example of unique architecture is the Wotrubakirche by sculptor Fritz Wotruba. In the 1990s, a number of quarters were adapted and extensive building projects were implemented in the areas around Donaustadt (north of the Danube) and Wienerberg (in southern Vienna). The 220-meter high DC Tower 1 located on the Northern bank of the Danube, completed in 2013, is the talltest skyscraper in Vienna. In recent years, Vienna has seen numerous architecture projects completed which combine modern architectural elements with old buildings, such as the remodelling and revitalisation of the old Gasometer in 2001. Most buildings in Vienna are relatively low; in early 2006 there were around 100 buildings higher than 40 m. The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation aimed at preserving green areas and districts designated as world cultural heritage. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings. Consequently, much of the inner city is a high-rise free zone. The west front is of the screen-type, clearly deriving from that at Wells. It is composed of two stair turrets at each extremity, with two niched buttresses nearer the centre line supporting the large central triple window. The stair turrets are topped with spirelets and the central section is topped by a gable which contains four lancet windows topped by two round quatrefoil windows surmounted by a mandorla containing Christ in Majesty. At ground level there is a principal door flanked by two smaller doors. The whole is highly decorated with quatrefoil motifs, columns, trefoil motifs and bands of diapering. The west front was almost certainly constructed at the same time as the cathedral. This is apparent from the way in which the windows coincide with the interior spaces. The entire façade is about 33 metres high and wide. It has been said that the front was built on a scale smaller than was initially planned. It lacks full-scale towers and/or spires as can be seen, for example at Wells, Lincoln, Lichfield, etc. The facade is disparaged by Alec Clifton-Taylor, who comments that it is the least successful of the English screen-facades and is a travesty of its prototype (Wells). He finds the composition to be unco-ordinated, and the Victorian statuary poor and insipid. The front accommodates over 130 shallow niches of varying sizes, 73 of these niches contains a statue. The line of niches extend round the turrets to the north, south and east faces. There are five levels of niches (not including the mandorla) which show, from the top, angels and archangels, Old Testament patriarchs, apostles and evangelists, martyrs, doctors and philosophers and, on the lower level, royalty, priests and worthy people connected with the cathedral. The majority of the statues were placed during the middle of the 19th century, however seven are from the 14th century and several have been installed within the last decade. Salisbury Cathedral is unusual for its tall and narrow nave, and has visual accentuation due to the use of light grey Chilmark stone for the walls and dark polished Purbeck marble for the columns. It has three levels: a tall pointed arcade, an open gallery and a small clerestory. Lined up between the pillars are notable tombs such as that of William Longespée, half brother of King John and the illegitimate son of Henry II, who was the first person to be buried in the cathedral. Renaissance architecture is the architecture of the period between the early 15th and early 17th centuries in different regions of Europe, demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman thought and material culture. Stylistically, Renaissance architecture followed Gothic architecture and was succeeded by Baroque architecture. Developed first in Florence, with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to France, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact. The obvious distinguishing features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects. However, the forms and purposes of buildings had changed over time, as had the structure of cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models for the type of large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes. Renaissance style places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aedicules replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings. Columns and pilasters  The Roman orders of columns are used:- Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The orders can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches are semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the St. Andrea in Mantua. Vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault which is frequently rectangular. The barrel vault is returned to architectural vocabulary as at the St. Andrea in Mantua. The dome is used frequently, both as a very large structural feature that is visible from the exterior, and also as a means of roofing smaller spaces where they are only visible internally. After the success of the dome in Brunelleschi’s design for the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore and its use in Bramante’s plan for St. Peter's Basilica (1506) in Rome, the dome became an indispensable element in church architecture and later even for secular architecture, such as Palladio's Villa Rotonda. Roofs are fitted with flat or coffered ceilings. They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are frequently painted or decorated. Doors usually have square lintels. They may be set within an arch or surmounted by a triangular or segmental pediment. Openings that do not have doors are usually arched and frequently have a large or decorative keystone. Windows may be paired and set within a semi-circular arch. They may have square lintels and triangular or segmental pediments, which are often used alternately. Emblematic in this respect is the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, begun in 1517. Courtyard of Palazzo Strozzi, Florence In the Mannerist period the “Palladian” arch was employed, using a motif of a high semi-circular topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring light into the building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature. External walls are generally constructed of brick, rendered, or faced with stone in highly finished ashlar masonry, laid in straight courses. The corners of buildings are often emphasised by rusticated quoins. Basements and ground floors were often rusticated, as at the Palazzo Medici Riccardi (1444–1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with lime wash. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with frescoes. Courses, mouldings and all decorative details are carved with great precision. Studying and mastering the details of the ancient Romans was one of the important aspects of Renaissance theory. The different orders each required different sets of details. Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, but there was also a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic Architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture. Baroque architecture is the building style of the Baroque era, begun in late 16th-century Italy, that took the Roman vocabulary of Renaissance architecture and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion, often to express the triumph of the Catholic Church and the absolutist state. It was characterized by new explorations of form, light and shadow and dramatic intensity. 
Architecture The largest area of the square on the south side, Resselpark, is named after the inventor Josef Ressel. To the east is St. Charles Church, located in front of a water pool with a sculpture by Henry Moore with the building of the Vienna Museum (formerly the Historical Museum of Vienna) and the Winterthur Insurance building. On the west side of it is the main building of the Technische Universität Wien (Vienna Technical University) and the Protestant school. In Resselpark, monuments and busts are of famous people such as the inventor Siegfried Marcus and Josef Madersperger, as well as the composer Johannes Brahms. On the north side of the Otto Wagner in Art Nouveau style building erected inclusion of the former station Karlsplatz the Vienna Stadtbahn. 
Architecture Henry Spencer Moore OM CH FBA RBS (30 July 1898 – 31 August 1986) was an English sculptor and artist. He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art.
History Scottish and Irish missionaries (Iro-Scottish, Hiberno-Scottish) were instrumental in the spread of Christianity in Continental Europe during the Middle Ages. Of special importance in Austria is Saint Koloman of Stockerau (of Melk) killed near Vienna in 1012. This Iro-Scottish monk of royal lineage killed at Stockerau while on pilgrimage to Jerusalem has been patron saint of Austria until 1663. During the 11th and the 12th century, Scottish Monasteries intended for Scottish and Irish monks exclusively sprang up. The famous Scottish Monastery of St. Jacob at Ratisbon was built around 1090 by Burgrave Otto of Ratisbon in Ratisbon became the mother-house of a series of other Scots Monasteries, among which the Our Blessed Lady at Vienna built in 1158.
History On September 16, 1638, Emperor Ferdinand III allowed the Servite Order to found a monastery in Vienna. Inspired by Italian architect Andrea Palladio, the church of the Servites was built by Martin Carlone and dedicated to the Annunciation to the Virgin. The foundation stone was laid on November 11, 1751 and the church was consecrated in 1760 though the interior decoration was completed later. The most important work of art in the church is the "Pietà" at the altar of Our Lady of Sorrows. The tomb of general Ottavio Piccolomini, who was an active patron of the church, is located under this altar. Another patron of the church was Baron Christoph of Abele who donated the "Liborius altar".
History The history of Vienna has been long and varied, beginning when the Roman Empire created a military camp in the area covered by Vienna's city centre. From that humble beginning, Vienna grew from the Roman settlement known as Vindobona to be an important trading site in the 11th century. It became the capital of the Babenberg dynasty and subsequently of the Austrian Habsburgs, under whom it became one of Europe's cultural hubs. During the 19th century as the capital of the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary, it temporarily became one of Europe's biggest cities. Since World War I, Vienna has been the capital of the Republic of Austria.
History Before 1850, Innere Stadt was physically equivalent with the city of Vienna. See History of Vienna for details about the history of Vindobona and Vienna, as well as historical significance after 1850.
History Vindobona (from Gaulish windo- "white" and bona "base/bottom") was a Celtic settlement and later a Roman military camp on the site of the modern city of Vienna in Austria.
Architecture Built of steel, the Palmenhaus is 111 metres long, 28 metres wide and 25 metres high, and has 45,000 glass tiles. There are annexes on the north and south sides, serving as a coldhouse and a hothouse respectively.
Sports Association football, commonly known as football or soccer, is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world’s most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by using any part of the body besides the arms and hands to get the football into the opposing goal. The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organizes a World Cup every four years. Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players, one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws. The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewelry or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials. A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or time wasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match. IFAB recommends that that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team. Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations. A game is officiated by a referee, who has full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise. The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 centimeters (27 and 28 in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 grams (14 to 16 oz), and a pressure of between 0.6 and 1.1 bars (8.5 and 15.6 psi) at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurization, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic. As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though popular use tends to continue to use traditional units in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain. The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 m (110–120 yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 m (70–80 yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 m (100–130 yd) length and 45–90 m (50–100 yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 m (344 ft) long and 68 m (223 ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented. The longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32 m (8 yd) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44 m (8 ft) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws. In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks. A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signaled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also stands that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken. Some football competitions use a penalty shootout to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw. In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock, some competitions may invoke replays. A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as kicks from the penalty mark) to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score). In competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB. Fußballklub Austria Wien known in English as Austria Vienna, and usually shortened to Austria in German-speaking countries, is an Austrian association football club from the capital city of Vienna. It has won 24 Austrian Bundesliga titles, surpassed only by cross-city rival SK Rapid Wien. With 27 victories in the Austrian Cup and six in the Austrian Supercup, Austria Wien is the most successful club in each of those tournaments. The club reached the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final in 1978, and the semi-finals of the European Cup the season after. The club plays at the Franz Horr Stadium, known as the Generali Arena since a 2010 naming rights deal with an Italian insurance company. Austria Wien contests the Wien derby with Rapid Wien. The two clubs are the most supported and successful in the country, and two of the most culturally and socially significant clubs, both historically representing wider divisions in Viennese society. Both teams originate from Hietzing, the 13th district in the west of the city, but have since moved into different districts. While Austria Wien is seen as a middle-class club, and before World War II as part of the coffeehouse culture associated with the capital's Intelligentsia. Rapid traditionally holds the support of the city's working class. The two clubs first met in a league championship match on 8 September 1911, a 4-1 victory for Rapid. The fixture is the most-played derby in European football after the Old Firm match in Glasgow, Scotland. Sportklub Rapid Wien, often called Rapid Vienna in English, is an Austrian football club playing in the country's capital city of Vienna. Rapid is the most popular club in Austria, and also the most successful in terms of league titles. It has won 32 Austrian league titles, and a German championship in 1941 during Nazi rule. Rapid twice reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985 and 1996, losing on both occasions. The club is often known as the Die Grün-Weißen (Green-whites) for its team colors or as Hütteldorfer, in reference to the location of the Gerhard Hanappi Stadium, which is in Hütteldorf, part of the city's 14th district, Penzing. The use of banned performance-enhancing drugs in sports is commonly referred to as doping, particularly by the organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee, although ethicists have argued that it is not different from the use of new materials in the construction of suits and sporting equipment, which can also aid performance and give competitors an unfair advantage. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the spirit of sport. In sports where physical strength is favored, athletes have used anabolic steroids, known for their ability to increase physical strength and muscle mass. The drug mimics the effect of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in the body. They were developed after Eastern Bloc countries demonstrated success in weightlifting during the 1940s. At the time they were using testosterone, which carried with it negative effects, anabolic steroids were developed as a solution. The drug has been used across a wide range of sports from football and basketball to weightlifting and track and field. While not as life-threatening as the drugs used in endurance sports, anabolic steroids have negative side effects. Side effects in men: acne, impaired liver function, impotency, breast formation (gynecomastia), increase in estrogen, erectile dysfunction, increased sex drive, male pattern baldness. Side effects in women: hair loss, male pattern baldness, hypertrophy of the clitoris, increased sex drive, irregularities of the menstrual cycle, development of masculine facial traits, increased coarseness of the skin, premature closure of the epiphysis. In countries where the use of these drugs is controlled, there is often a black market trade of smuggled or counterfeit drugs. The quality of these drugs may be poor and can cause health risks. In countries where anabolic steroids are strictly regulated, some have called for a regulatory relief. Steroids are available over-the-counter in some countries such as Thailand and Mexico. The modern Olympic Games are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes across the planet participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered to be the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority. The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games. The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic program, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and acts of terrorism. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world. The Olympic Games program consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and nearly 400 events. For example, wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class. The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports. Athletics, swimming, fencing, and artistic gymnastics are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been featured at every Winter Olympics program since its inception in 1924. Current Olympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and volleyball, first appeared on the program as demonstration sports, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the program. Olympic sports are governed by international sports federations (IFs) recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC. There are sports recognized by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a program revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games. During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the program on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC. There are recognized sports that have never been on an Olympic program in any capacity, including chess and surfing. In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic program and all non-Olympic recognized sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic program for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic program. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognized sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic program. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games. The 114th IOC Session, in 2002, limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major program revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official program of the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 program featured just 26 sports. The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf. The Paralympic Games is a major international multi-sport event, involving athletes with a range of physical disabilities, including impaired muscle power (e.g. paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, Post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency (e.g. amputation or dysmelia), leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The Paralympics have grown from a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948 to become one of the largest international sporting events by the early 21st century. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes. The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with the Olympic Games, while the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities, and the Deaflympics include deaf athletes. Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have, there are several categories in which the athletes compete. The allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types. The categories are impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. These categories are further broken down into classifications, which vary from sport to sport. The classification system has led to cheating controversies revolving around athletes who over-stated their disabilities, in addition to the use of performance-enhancing drugs seen in other events. Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each on a field at the center of which is a rectangular 22-yard long pitch. Each team takes its turn to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields. Each turn is known as an innings. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman who attempts to hit the ball with his bat away from the fielders so he can run to the other end of the pitch and score a run. Each batsman continues batting until he is out. The batting team continues batting until ten batsmen are out, or a specified number of overs of six balls have been bowled, at which point the teams switch roles and the fielding team comes in to bat. In professional cricket the length of a game ranges from 20 overs per side to Test cricket played over five days. The Laws of Cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) with additional Standard Playing Conditions for Test matches and One Day Internationals. Cricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each. One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent. In some forms of cricket, it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn. There are separate leagues for Women's cricket, though informal matches may have mixed teams. A cricket match is divided into periods called innings (which ends with s in both singular and plural form). It is decided before the match whether the teams will have one innings or two innings each. During an innings one team fields and the other bats. The two teams switch between fielding and batting after each innings. All eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but only two members of the batting team (two batsmen) are on the field at any given time. The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied. A coin toss is held by the team captains (who are also players) just before the match starts: the winner decides whether to bat or field first. The cricket field is usually oval in shape, with a rectangular pitch at the center. The edge of the playing field is marked with a boundary, which could be a fence, part of the stands, a rope or a painted line. At each end of the pitch is a wooden target called a wicket, placed 22 yards apart. The pitch is marked with painted lines: a bowling crease in line with the wicket, and a batting or popping crease four feet in front of it. The wicket is made of three vertical stumps supporting two small horizontal bails. A wicket is put down if at least one bail is dislodged, or one stump is knocked down (usually by the ball, but also if the batsman does it with his body, clothing or equipment). This is also described as breaking, knocking down, or hitting the wicket– though if the ball hits the wicket but does not dislodge a bail or stump then it is not down. At any instant each batsman owns a particular wicket (usually the one closer to him) and, except when actually batting, is safe when he is in his ground. This means that at least one part of his body or bat is touching the ground behind the popping crease. If his wicket is put down while the ball is live and he is out of his ground then he is dismissed, but the other batsman is safe. A ball being bowled. From back to front -- umpire (with hat), wicket, non-striking batsman (yellow), bowler (blue), ball, pitch, crease, striking batsman (yellow), wicket, wicket keeper (blue,crouching) and fielder (blue,slip position). The two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the pitch. One designated member of the fielding team, called the bowler, bowls the ball from one end of the pitch to the striking batsman at the other end. The batsman at the bowling end is called the non-striker, and stands to the side of his wicket, behind his crease. The batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases, though at some risk. Another member of the fielding team, the wicket keeper, is positioned behind the striker's wicket. The fielding team's other nine members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field. The fielding captain often strategically changes their position between balls. There is always an umpire at each end of the pitch. The bowler usually retreats a few yards (meters) behind the wicket, runs towards it (his run-up), and then releases the ball over-hand as he reaches the bowling crease. (If he crosses the crease before he releases the ball, or if he flexes his elbow too much in a throw, then it is a no ball, and the batting team gets a penalty or extra run. If the ball passes the far wicket out of reach of the batsman then it is called a wide, also with an extra run.) The ball can be bowled so that it bounces on the pitch, lands exactly on the crease (a yorker), or crosses the crease without bouncing (a full toss). The batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with his bat. (This includes the handle of the bat, and his gloves.) If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed and is said to be bowled out. If the batsman misses the ball, but any part of his body prevents it from reaching the wicket, then he is out leg before wicket, or LBW. If the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a fielder without bouncing then he caught out. If it is caught by the bowler then he is caught and bowled; by the wicket keeper, caught behind. If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not caught without bouncing, then the two batsmen may try to score points (runs) for their team. Both batsmen run the length of the pitch, exchanging positions, and grounding their bats behind the opposite crease. Each crossing and grounding by both batsmen is worth one run. The batsmen may attempt one run, multiple runs, or elect not to run at all. By attempting runs, the batsmen risk dismissal. This happens if the fielding team retrieves the ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it, or while holding it) before the batsman who owns that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease. The dismissed batsman is run out. Batsmen will sometimes start to run, change their mind, and return to their original positions. If the batsman hits the ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team scores six runs. If the ball touches the ground and then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four runs. The batsmen might start running before the ball reaches the boundary, but those runs don't count. If the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra runs: these are called byes. If the ball bounces off his body then it is called a leg bye. If the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the ball, then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the wicket – stumped. In case of a no ball or a wide the batsman can choose to strike the ball, earning runs in addition to the fixed penalty. If he does so he can only be dismissed by being run out. When the batsmen have finished attempting their runs the ball is dead, and is returned to the bowler to be bowled again. The ball becomes live when he starts his run up. The bowler continues to bowl toward the same wicket, regardless of any switch of the batsmen's positions. A batsman may retire from an innings without being dismissed, usually after reaching a milestone like a hundred runs (a century). A dismissed batsman leaves the field, to be replaced by another batsman from the batting team. However, even though the wicket may have been put down, or the ball caught, the batsman is not actually dismissed until the fielding team appeal to the umpires for a decision, traditionally using the expression How's that (or Howzat). In some matches, particularly test matches, either team may request a review by a third umpire who can use a Decision Review System (DRS), which includes TV replays and other electronic equipment such as hawk eye, hotspot and the snickometer. After a bowler has bowled six times (an over), another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler, the old bowler taking up a fielding position. The batsmen stay in place, and the new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket, so the role of striker and non-striker reverse. The wicket keeper and the two umpires always change positions, as do many of the fielders, and play continues. Fielding team members may bowl multiple times during an innings, but may not bowl two overs in succession. The innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed (all out– although one always remaining not out), when a set number of overs has been played, or when the batting team declares that they have enough runs. The number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match. In a match which is not a limited overs format the umpires will usually specify that the last session of the last innings will have a specified number of overs. The match always ends when all innings have been completed. The umpires can also call an end to the match in case of bad light or weather. But in many cases the match ends immediately when the first team to bat has played all of its innings, and the last team to bat has more runs. In four-innings games the last team may not even need to play its second innings: this team is said to win by an innings. If this winning team has not completed its last innings, and still has, for example, five batsmen who are not out or have not even batted, then they are said to win by five wickets. If the last team to bat is losing, is all out, and has 10 fewer runs than the other team, then the winning team wins by 10 runs. If the two teams both play all their innings and they have the same number of runs, then it is a tie. In four-innings matches there is also the possibility of a draw: the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the field when the game ends. This has a major effect on strategy: a team will often declare an innings when they have accumulated enough runs, in the hope that they will have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus avoid a draw, but risking a loss if the other team scores enough runs. Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.0 m) high mounted to a backboard at each end. Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports. A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal scores two points for the shooting team if a player is touching or closer to the basket than the three-point line, and three points (known commonly as a 3 pointer or three) if the player is behind the three-point line. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends with a draw. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running or throwing it to a team mate. It is a violation to move without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. Violations are called fouls. A personal foul is penalized, and a free throw is usually awarded to an offensive player if he is fouled while shooting the ball. A technical foul may also be issued when certain infractions occur, most commonly for unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of a player or coach. A technical foul gives the opposing team a free throw, and the opposing team also retains possession of the ball. As well as many techniques for shooting, passing, dribbling and rebounding, basketball has specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures (player positioning). Typically, the tallest and strongest members of a team will play the center or power forward positions, while slightly shorter and more agile players will play small forward, and the shortest players or those who possess the best ball handling skills and speed play point guard or shooting guard. The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems. An outdoor basketball net. A regulation basketball court in international games is 91.9 feet long and 49.2 feet wide. In the NBA and NCAA the court is 94 feet by 50 feet. Most courts have wood flooring, usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension. The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle. The basket is a steel rim 18inches diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures 6 feet by 3.5 feet and one basket is at each end of the court. The white outlined box on the backboard is 18inches high and 2 feet wide. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly 10 feet above the court and 4 feet inside the baseline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height – a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting. The size of the basketball is also regulated. For men, the official ball is 29.5inches in circumference (size 7, or a 295 ball) and weighs 22 oz. If women are playing, the official basketball size is 28.5inches in circumference (size 6, or a 285 ball) with a weight of 20 oz. The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running). The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. The ball is out of bounds if it touches or crosses over a boundary line, or touches a player who is out of bounds. This is in contrast to other sports such as football, volleyball, and tennis (but not rugby or American football) where the ball (or player) is still considered in if any part of it is touching a boundary line. The ball-handler may not step with both feet without dribbling, an infraction known as traveling, nor dribble with both hands or hold the ball and resume dribbling, a violation called double dribbling. Any part of the player's hand cannot be directly under the ball while dribbling; doing so is known as carrying the ball. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the back court and be the first to touch it. The ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession, or, if committed by the defense, a reset of the shot clock (with some exceptions in the NBA). There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA men's play and high school for both sexes, but no limit in NCAA women's play), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA and the NBA, 30 seconds in NCAA women's and Canadian Interuniversity Sport play for both sexes, and 35 seconds in NCAA men's play), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the key) (3 seconds). These rules are designed to promote more offense. No player may touch the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless it is obvious that the ball has no chance of entering the basket (goaltending). In addition, no player may touch the ball while it is on or in the basket; when any part of the ball is in the spacious cylinder above the basket (the area extended upwards from the basket); or when the ball is outside the cylinder, if the player reaches through the basket and touches it. This violation is known as basket interference. If a defensive player goal tends or commits basket interference, the basket is awarded and the offending team gets the ball. If a teammate of the player shooting goal tends or commits interference, the basket is canceled and play continues with the defensive team being given possession. Foul - an attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful. One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6m) from the basket. The referee may use discretion in calling fouls (for example, by considering whether an unfair advantage was gained), sometimes making fouls controversial calls or no-calls. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and even among referees. A player or coach who shows poor sportsmanship, such as by arguing with a referee or by fighting with another player, can be charged with a more serious foul called a technical foul. The penalty involves free throws (where, unlike a personal foul, the other team can choose any player to shoot) and varies among leagues. Repeated incidents can result in disqualification. A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA). In FIBA, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant. If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league. In the US college and high school games, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made. This is called shooting one-and-one. If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half. When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air. After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, it is said to be in the penalty. On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading Bonus or Penalty with an illuminated directional arrow indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team. (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.). If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play. If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot. A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot, then, receives two shots. A player fouled while attempting a three-point shot, on the other hand, receives three shots. If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point. In combination with a regular shot, this is called a three-point play or four-point play (or more colloquially, an and one) because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point). Hockey is a family of sports in which two teams play against each other by trying to maneuver a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. In many areas, one sport (typically field hockey or ice hockey) is generally referred to simply as hockey. Ice hockey is played on a large flat area of ice, using a three-inch-diameter (76.2 mm) vulcanized rubber disc called a puck. This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice. The game is contested between two teams of skaters. The game is played all over North America, Europe and in many other countries around the world to varying extent. It is the most popular sport in Canada, Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The governing body of international play is the 72-member International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Men's ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. Women's ice hockey was added to the Winter Olympics in 1998. North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic ice hockey over many categories. Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way, legally, as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage. Ice hockey was frequently played under the name hockey in England throughout the 19th century, and even earlier under various other names, in particular bandy. In Canada, there are 24 reports of hockey-like games in the 19th century before 1875 (5 of them using the name hockey), but the first organized game played in Canada took place on March 3, 1875, and featured several McGill University students. Ice hockey is the national sport of Latvia and the national winter sport of Canada. Ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all ages. Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a good return. The opponent who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite opponent will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis. During most of the 19th-century in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will go down to Hampton Court and play tennis. The rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tie-break in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point. Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open played also on hard courts. Tennis balls have come a long way from being made of cloth strips stitched together with thread. Tennis balls are made of hollow rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant color was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 65.41-68.58mm (2.575-2.700 inches). Balls must weigh between 56.0 and 59.4 grams (1.975-2.095 ounces). Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the United States and Europe. Although the process of producing the balls remains virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place is the Far East. The relocation is due to cheaper labor costs and materials in the region. Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964. A scene of volleyball play in an Erwadi village. The complete rules are extensive. But simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court. The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start the next rally. Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding. The offense attempts to score runs by hitting a ball thrown by the pitcher with a bat and moving counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game comprises nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Evolving from older bat-and-ball games, an early form of baseball was being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America and the Caribbean, East Asia, and Europe. In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central League and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. Golf is a precision club and ball sport in which competing players (or golfers) use many types of clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course using the fewest number of strokes. Golf is defined, in the rules of golf, as playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules. It is one of the few ball games that do not require a standardized playing area. Instead, the game is played on a course, in general consisting of an arranged progression of either nine or 18 holes. Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole. There are various other standardized forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough, and hazards, but each hole on a course, and indeed among virtually all courses, is unique in its specific layout and arrangement. Golf competition is generally played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known simply as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes during a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at virtually all levels of play, although variations of match play, such as skins games, are also seen in televised events. Other forms of scoring also exist. Wrestling is a combat sport involving grappling type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems. Boxing is a combat sport in which two people engage in a contest of strength, speed, reflexes, endurance, and will, by throwing punches at each other, usually with gloved hands. Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a common fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships. Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards at the end of the contest. While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before the dawn of history, the origin of boxing as an organized sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688. Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century, again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States. Karate is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Islands in what is now Okinawa, Japan. It developed from the indigenous martial arts of Ryukyu Islands, literally hand; tii in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts, particularly Fujian White Crane. Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching, kicking, knee strikes, elbow strikes and open hand techniques such as knife-hands, spear-hands, and palm-heel strikes. Historically and in some modern styles grappling, throws, joint locks, restraints, and vital point strikes are also taught. A karate practitioner is called a karateka. Skiing is a recreational activity and competitive sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee, and the International Ski Federation. 
Architecture The shape of the tower is formed by two clasped each other fully glazed cylinder which is supported by a steel composite structure. The Millennium Tower was designed by the architects Gustav Peichl, Boris Podrecca and Rudolf F. Weber. The operating contractor was the consortium Habau - Voestalpine - MCE.
History The centre was founded in 1993 as a non-profit organisation. It arose from a collaboration between the national government of Austria and the city of Vienna, and is jointly operated by the Federal Ministry of Education, Art and Culture and Vienna's offices of culture and urban development. After eight years in temporary exhibition venues in the Museumsquartier, the Az W moved into its present location in 2001. It has around 1,000 m2 of exhibition space at its disposal, and organised over 150 exhibitions, 300 events and 600 architectural excursions in its first 15 years.
History Since the Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Empire, including the Imperial Crown, were kept in Nuremberg and could only leave the city for a coronation, some rulers had their own personal crowns made. For example, when they attended a session of the Imperial Diet (Reichstag), they attended with their own crowns. The oldest depiction of such a private crown is an etching by the artist Albrecht Dürer of Emperor Maximilian I, where a depiction of a crown is seen that might have later influenced the appearance of the crown of Rudolf II. The Imperial Crown of the Habsburg Empire of Austria was never used for a coronation, since, unlike the Holy Roman Empire, it was a hereditary monarchy and such an act of legitimization was not seen as necessary. The ceremony held was an act of investiture to mark the monarch's official ascension to the throne rather than a coronation. The crown of Rudolf II was made in 1602 in Prague by Jan Vermeyen, one of the most outstanding goldsmiths of his time, who was called specially from Antwerp. The crown is made out of three parts: the circlet (Kronreif), the high arch (Kronbügel), and a mitre (Mitra). In the earlier forms of the Western mitre the peaks or horns were over the ears, rather than over the face and back of the head. The form of mitre used in the imperial mitral crown preserved this earlier form. This form of the imperial mitre-crown can be seen in the extant portraits of such emperors as Frederick III and Maximilian I The bronze effigy of Maximilian I found on his monumental cenotaph in the court church in Innsbruck has a crown with two arches which cross over the top of the mitre and the unique form of the imperial crown adopted by Maximilian as Emperor of Mexico appears to have been modeled on this form, but with the half-arches and the eagles on the circlet on the front, back and sides of the imperial crown of Napoleon III. In the later 17th century Baroque form of mitral crown of Leopold the peaks of the mitre have been rounded into the hemispherical form Peter the Great would adopt as the Imperial Crown of Russia when he took the title emperor as Russian sovereign. Although it is often assumed that the Imperial Crown made for Otto I with its single arch over its inner red cap was the original prototype for the western imperial crown, it is also possible that the Byzantine imperial crown, which in the twelfth century also became closed with two arches, inspired the western emperors to follow their example and also close their crowns with such a pair of arches.
History The Sundial House stands opposite the Schönbrunn Palm House (Palmenhaus; another botanical exhibit), directly between the Hietzing Gate and the Zoo. The unprepossessing building owes its name to the sundial (Sonnenuhr) located in the gardens to the south. It was built with the encouragement of Charles von Hügel – diplomat, explorer and founder of the Vienna Horticultural Society – to replace an earlier greenhouse which could no longer meet its plants' needs. At first it housed the plants of the extensive oNew Holland Collectiono which Hügel had assembled, and which had been acquired by the Imperial Court in 1848, and later expanded with plants from southern Africa and the Americas that required similar conditions. The architect of the 1904 building was Alphons Custodis. A bomb attack in February 1945, which almost totally destroyed the windows of the nearby Palm House, left the bulk of the Sundial House's glazing intact, probably because the Palm House stood between it and the bombed area, and because the Sundial House had windows which were roughly parallel to the spreading blast waves (unlike the Palm House). A number of plants from the Palm House were therefore brought here for safekeeping, where space allowed. The Sundial House again served as a refuge between 1986 and 1990, while the Palm House was renovated. In April 1990 the first butterfly zoo in Austria was established in the Sundial House, but it was transferred to the greenhouse in the Burggarten in 1998. Plants in the main hall. Rust on the steel framework caused the building to be closed in 1998 and renovated from 2000 to 2003. The Desert House was finally established here by a joint project between the Zoo and the Austrian Federal Gardens (Bundesgärten), which have managed the building since 1918 as successor to the Imperial and Royal Court Gardens. The exhibition includes succulent plants from the Federal Gardens, and small animals under the care of the Zoo, such as desert jerboas, reptiles and birds.
History The synagogue was constructed in 1824 and 1826. The luxurious Stadttempel was fitted into a block of houses and hidden from plain view of the street, because of an edict issued by Emperor Joseph II that only Roman Catholic places of worship were allowed to be built with facades fronting directly on to public streets. Ironically, this edict saved the synagogue from total destruction during the Kristallnacht in November 1938, since the synagogue could not be destroyed without setting on fire the buildings to which it was attached. The Stadttempel was the only synagogue in the city to survive World War II, as the Nazis destroyed all of the other 93 synagogues and Jewish prayer-houses in Vienna. In August 1950, the coffins of Theodor Herzl and his parents were displayed at the synagogue, prior to their transfer for reburial in Israel. In the 1981 Vienna synagogue attack, two people from a bar mitzvah ceremony at the synagogue were murdered and thirty injured when Palestinian Arab terrorists attacked the synagogue with machine guns and hand grenades. Today the synagogue is the main house of prayer for the Viennese Jewish Community of about 7,000 members. The synagogue has been declared a historic monument.
Architecture 300 ft. long, 45 ft. wide and 50 ft. high, the building is fully glazed on the roof and the south face, while the north face is walled up. With a total floor space of 14,000 sq. ft., the interior is divided lengthwise into three sections; there are two annexes to the central section, namely a plant-rich east wing which serves as the entrance hall, and a west wing used as a coldhouse.
Architecture The synagogue was designed in elegant Biedermeier style the Viennese architect Joseph Kornhäusel, architect to Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein, for whom he had built palaces, theaters and other buildings. Construction was supervised by the official municipal architect, Jacob Heinz. Two five-story apartment houses, Numbers 2 and 4 Seitenstettengasse were built at the same time as the synagogue, designed by the architect to screen the synagogue from the street in compliance with the Patent of Toleration, which permitted members of tolerated faiths ot worship in clandestine churches, but not in buildings with facades on public streets. The synagogue is structurally attached to the apartment building at # 4 Seitenstettengasse. The synagogue itself is in the form of an oval. A ring of twelve Ionic columns support a two-tiered women's gallery. Originally, the galleries ended one column away from the Torah Ark, they were later extended to the columns beside the ark to provide more seating. the building is domed and lit by a lantern in the center of the dome, in classic Biedermeyer style. A commemorative glass made at the time of the synagogue's dedication and etched with a detailed image of the synagogue's interior is now in the collection of the Jewish Museum (New York). The synagogue underwent renovation in 1895 and again in 1904 by the Jewish architect Wilhelm Stiassny, adding considerable ornamentation, and, in the opinion of architectural historian Rachel Wischnitzer, "the serene harmony of the design was spoiled by renovations." Damage inflicted on Kristallnacht was repaired in 1949. The "Stadttempel" was renovated once again in 1963 by Prof. Otto Niedermoser.
History Kahlenberg was uninhabited until the 18th century. Originally, the mountain was called Sauberg (sow mountain) or Schweinsberg (pig mountain), after the numerous wild pigs that lived in the pristine oak forests. In 1628, Ferdinand II acquired the mountain from the Klosterneuburg monastery and called it Josephsberg (Joseph's Mountain). Only after Emperor Leopold I renamed the original Kahlenberg (the neighbouring mountain) to Leopoldsberg was the name "Kahlenberg" given to the "Josephsberg". After acquiring the mountain, Ferdinand II allowed a hermitage for the Kamaldulenser, an order of Catholic hermits, to be built. A few houses were built around the Chapel of Saint Joseph, which earned the name Josefsdorf. Jan III Sobieski, King of Poland launched his attack on the Turkish forces during the second siege of Vienna from here. The Turkish name of the city is Alamandağı. The mountain is also notable as the place where Albert Einstein, Otto Neurath, and other mathematicians and physicists made the first plans, around 1920, for what would later become the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science.
Geography Kahlenberg is 484 meters high and lies in the northeastern foothills of the Eastern Alps. The mountain is mostly flysch, which is composed of quartz, limestone, marl, and other conglomerates. East of Kahlenberg is Leopoldsberg; and to the west is Reisenberg, Latisberg, and Hermannskogel.
